		==// == 保罗·亨利·尼采（Paul Henry Nitze，1907年1月—2004年10月），美国政府高级官员，曾在多届美国政府当中参与冷战政策的制定。1950年5月，尼采曾制定计划拟帮助时任中华民国司令孙立人取代蒋介石 / // 保罗·尼采高级国际研究学院 // His parents were both of German descent. His ancestors came from the region of Magdeburg in the state of Saxony-Anhalt, Germany. In his memoir, From Hiroshima to Glasnost, Paul Nitze describes how as a young boy he witnessed the outbreak of World War I while he was traveling in Germany with his father, mother, and sister, arriving in Munich just in time to be struck by the city crowds' patriotic enthusiasm for the imminent conflict.
		
		In 1928 and 1929, the Chicago brokerage firm of Bacon, Whipple and Company sent Nitze to Europe. Upon his return, he heard Clarence Dillon predict the Great Depression and the decline of the importance of finance. Having attained financial independence through the sale to Revlon of his interest in a French laboratory producing pharmaceutical products in the United States, Nitze took an intellectual sabbatical that included a year of graduate study at Harvard in sociology, philosophy, and constitutional and international law. In 1929 he joined investment bank Dillon, Read & Co. where he remained until founding his own firm, P. H. Nitze & Co, in 1938. He returned to Dillon, Read as Vice-President from 1939 through to 1941. In 1932, he married Phyllis Pratt, daughter of John Teele Pratt, a Standard Oil financier, and of Ruth Baker Pratt, Republican Congresswoman for New York. She died in 1987. They had four children: Heidi, Peter, William, and Phyllis Anina (Nina). The journalist Nicholas Thompson, who wrote a biography of Nitze and George F. Kennan, is his grandson.  He was married to Elisabeth Scott Porter from 1993 until his death in 2004. Nitze's brother-in-law, Walter Paepcke, founded the Aspen Institute and Aspen Skiing Company. Nitze continued to ski in Aspen until well into his 80s.
		
		In the early postwar era and Cold War, he served in the Truman Administration as Director of Policy Planning for the State Department (1950–1953). He was also the principal author in 1950 of the highly influential but secret National Security Council policy paper, NSC 68, which provided the strategic outline for increased US expenditures to counter the perceived threat of Soviet armament. During the Korean War, he advised the Truman administration against blaming the Soviet Union for the conflict too directly in order to avoid risking an escalation to World War III. From 1953 to 1961, Nitze served as president of the Foreign Service Educational Foundation while concurrently serving as associate of the Washington Center of Foreign Policy Research and the School of Advanced International Studies (SAIS) of the Johns Hopkins University. In 1956 he attended the Project Nobska anti-submarine warfare conference, where discussion ranged from oceanography to nuclear weapons. Nitze co-founded the School of Advanced International Studies (SAIS) with Christian Herter in 1943 and the world-renowned graduate school, based in Washington, D.C., is named in his honor. His publications during this period include U.S. Foreign Policy: 1945–1955. In 1961, President Kennedy appointed Nitze Assistant Secretary of Defense for International Security Affairs. In 1963, Nitze became the Secretary of the Navy, serving until 1967. According to the US Navy "as the Navy secretary, he raised the level of attention given to quality of Service issues. His many achievements included establishing the first Personnel Policy Board and retention task force (the Alford Board), and obtaining targeted personnel bonuses. He lengthened commanding officer tours and raised command responsibility pay. Paul Nitze was a cofounder of Team B, a 1970s intelligence think tank that challenged the National Intelligence Estimates provided by the CIA. The Team B reports became the intellectual foundation for the idea of "the window of vulnerability" and of the massive arms buildup that began toward the end of the Carter administration and accelerated under President Ronald Reagan. Team B came to the conclusion that the Soviets had developed new weapons of mass destruction and had aggressive strategies with regard to a potential nuclear war. Team B's analysis of Soviet weapon systems was later believed to be largely exaggerated. According to Anne Cahn of the Arms Control and Disarmament Agency (1977–1980), "if you go through most of Team B's specific allegations about weapons systems, and you just examine them one by one, they were all wrong." Nonetheless, some still claim that its conclusions about Soviet strategical aims were largely proven to be true, but this hardly squares with the elevation of Gorbachev in 1985.[11] Nitze was President Ronald Reagan's chief negotiator of the Intermediate-Range Nuclear Forces Treaty (1981–1984). In 1984, Nitze was named Special Advisor to the President and Secretary of State on Arms Control.
		
		For more than forty years, Nitze was one of the chief architects of US policy toward the Soviet Union.

		莫蒂默·杰尔姆·阿德勒（Mortimer Jerome Adler，1902年—2001年）是一名美国哲学家。 阿德勒于1902年12月28日出生在美国纽约市的一个犹太移民家庭。14岁从中学辍学后，成为纽约太阳报的送稿人员，他当时立志想要成为一名记者 。不久，阿德勒开始在夜间学习写作课程，从中他发现以下作者堪称英雄:柏拉图、亚里斯多德、托马斯·阿奎那、约翰·洛克、约翰·斯图尔特·密尔等等。之后，他进入哥伦比亚大学继续学习，同时还向学生文艺杂志投稿。尽管由于没能通过必修的游泳测验，而没能获得学士学位（1983年，哥伦比亚大学授予了他一个荣誉学位以作为补偿），阿德勒还是留在了大学，最终得到了一个讲师的位置，并获得了心理学博士学位 。 1930年，阿德勒前往芝加哥大学，并由之前认识的朋友、新任校长罗伯特·梅纳德·哈钦斯安排为芝加哥大学法学院的法律哲学教授。然而他受到了芝加哥的一些哲学家的质疑，这些人对他“能否胜任哲学教授这个职责怀有重大疑问”，并且抵制阿德勒成为该大学哲学系的一分子。而同时，阿德勒也是该学校法学院有史以来第一个非律师出身的教师。
		Adler was born in Manhattan, New York City, on December 28, 1902, to Jewish immigrants from Germany: Clarissa (Manheim), a schoolteacher, and Ignatz Adler, a jewelry salesman.  He dropped out of school at age 14 to become a copy boy for the New York Sun, with the ultimate aspiration of becoming a journalist. Adler soon returned to school to take writing classes at night, where he discovered the western philosophical tradition. Encyclopedia and Educational Reform
		Adler and Hutchins went on to found the Great Books of the Western World program and the Great Books Foundation. In 1952, Adler founded and served as director of the Institute for Philosophical Research. He also served on the Board of Editors of Encyclopædia Britannica, compiled its Syntopicon and later Propaedia, and succeeded Hutchins as its chairman from 1974. As the director of editorial planning for the fifteenth edition of Britannica from 1965, he was instrumental in the major reorganization of knowledge embodied in that edition.  He introduced the Paideia Proposal which resulted in his founding the Paideia Program, a grade school curriculum centered around guided reading and discussion of difficult works (as judged for each grade). With Max Weismann, he founded the Center for the Study of the Great Ideas in 1990 in Chicago. Adler was born into a nonobservant Jewish family. In his early twenties, he discovered St. Thomas Aquinas, and in particular the Summa Theologica.  Many years later, he wrote that its "intellectual austerity, integrity, precision and brilliance ... put the study of theology highest among all of my philosophical interests."  An enthusiastic Thomist, he was a frequent contributor to Catholic philosophical and educational journals, as well as a frequent speaker at Catholic institutions, so much so that some assumed he was a convert to Catholicism. But that was reserved for later. In 1940, James T. Farrell called Adler "the leading American fellow-traveller of the Roman Catholic Church." What was true for Adler, Farrell said, was what was "postulated in the dogma of the Roman Catholic Church," and he "sang the same tune" as avowed Catholic philosophers like Étienne Gilson, Jacques Maritain, and Martin D'Arcy. He also greatly admired Henri Bergson, the French Jewish philosopher and Nobel laureate, whose books the Catholic church had indexed as prohibited. Bergson refused to convert during the collaborationist Vichy regime, and despite the Statute on Jews he instead restated his previous views and was thus stripped of all his previous posts and honors.  Farrell attributed Adler's delay in joining the Church to his being among those Christians who "wanted their cake and ... wanted to eat it too" and compared him to the Emperor Constantine, who waited until he was on his deathbed to formally become a Catholic.
		
		罗杰·莫蒂默，第一代马奇伯爵（英语：Roger Mortimer，1st earl of March约1287年—1330年11月29日）英格兰贵族，第一代马奇伯爵（1328年起）和第八代威格莫尔男爵（1304年起）。在爱德华三世成年前，他曾是英格兰的真正统治者。
		
		A Marcher lord (Welsh: Barwn y Mers) was a noble appointed by the king of England to guard the border (known as the Welsh Marches) between England and Wales. A Marcher lord was the English equivalent of a margrave (in the Holy Roman Empire) or a marquis (in France) before the introduction of the title of "marquess" in Britain; no Marcher lord ever bore this rank. In this context the word march means a border region or frontier, and is cognate with the verb "to march", both ultimately derived from Proto-Indo-European *mereg-, "edge" or "boundary".
		
		The greatest Marcher lords included the earls of Chester, Gloucester, Hereford, Pembroke and Shrewsbury (see also English earls of March).
		
		Marcher powers
		The Anglo-Norman lordships in this area were distinct in several ways: they were geographically compact and jurisdictionally separate one from another, and they had special privileges which separated them from the usual English lordships. Royal writ did not work in the Marches: Marcher lords ruled their lands by their own law—sicut regale ("like a king") as Gilbert, Earl of Gloucester, stated,[1] whereas in England fief-holders were directly accountable to the king. Marcher lords could build castles, a jealously guarded and easily revoked Royal privilege in England. Marcher lords administered laws, waged war, established market towns, and maintained their own chanceries that kept their records (which have been completely lost). They had their own deputies, or sheriffs. Sitting in their own courts they had jurisdiction over all cases at law save high treason. "They could establish forests and forest laws, declare and wage war, establish boroughs, and grant extensive charters of liberties. They could confiscate the estates of traitors and felons, and regrant these at will. They could establish and preside over their own petty parliaments and county courts. Finally, they could claim any and every feudal due, aid, grant, and relief",  although they did not mint coins. Their one insecurity, if they did not take up arms against the king, was of dying without a legitimate heir, whereupon the title reverted to the Crown in escheat. Welsh law was frequently used in the Marches in preference to English law, and there would sometimes be a dispute as to which code should be used to decide a particular case.
		
		Feudal social structures, which were never fully established in England, took root in the Marches, which was not legally part of the realm of England. The traditional view has been that the Norman monarchy granted these outright. A revisionist view is that such rights were more common in the 11th century throughout the Conquest, but were largely suppressed in England, and survived in the Marches. Settlement was encouraged: knights were granted their own lands, which they held in feudal service to the Norman lords. Settlement was also encouraged in towns that were given market privileges, under the protection of a Norman keep. Peasants came to Wales in large numbers: Henry I encouraged Bretons, Flemings, Normans, and English settlers to move into the south of Wales.
		
		What happened to Roger Mortimer? In spite of Isabella's entreaty to her son, "Fair son, have pity on the gentle Mortimer", Mortimer was conveyed to the Tower. Accused of assuming royal power and of various other high misdemeanours, he was condemned without trial and hanged at Tyburn on 29 November 1330, his vast estates forfeited to the crown.
		
		克里斯蒂安·阿奇博尔德·赫脱（Christian Archibald Herter，1895年3月28日—1966年12月30日），美国政治家，生于法国巴黎，曾任马萨诸塞州州长、第53任美国国务卿和首任美国贸易代表，Albert Herter (March 2, 1871 – February 15, 1950) was an American painter, illustrator, muralist, and interior designer. He was born in New York City, studied at the Art Students League with James Carroll Beckwith, then in Paris with Jean-Paul Laurens and Fernand Cormon.
		
		He came from an artistic family; his father, Christian Herter (1839–1883), had co-founded Herter Brothers, a prominent New York interior design and furnishings firm. Herter Brothers closed in 1906, and Albert founded Herter Looms in 1909, a tapestry and textile design-and-manufacturing firm that was, in a sense, successor to his father's firm. In Paris, he met a fellow American art student, Adele McGinnis. They were married in 1893 and had three children: Everit Albert (1894–1918), Christian Archibald (1895–1966), and Lydia Adele (1898–1951). The couple honeymooned in Japan, then returned to Paris for the first years of their marriage. In 1898 they moved back to the United States and built a Mediterranean-style villa, called "Près Choisis" (later called "The Creeks"), in East Hampton, New York, with a studio for each of them. Herter's mother built a mansion, "El Mirasol," in Santa Barbara, California, where the family spent the winters. Following his mother's death, Herter and his wife renovated the mansion and converted it into a boutique hotel. Son Everit and daughter Lydia also became artists although Everit was killed at age 24 in World War I. Son Christian became a politician, serving as governor of Massachusetts and later U.S. Secretary of State under Dwight D. Eisenhower. Adele Herter was a founding member of New York City's Cosmopolitan Club, and is remembered as a painter of still lifes and "Society" portraits.
		
		The firm of Herter Brothers, (working 1864–1906), was founded by German immigrants Gustave (1830–1898) and Christian Herter (1839–1883) in New York City. It began as a furniture and upholstery shop/warehouse, but after the Civil War became one of the first American firms to provide complete interior decoration services. With their own design office and cabinet-making and upholstery workshops, Herter Brothers could provide every aspect of interior furnishing—including decorative paneling, mantels, wall and ceiling decoration, patterned floors, carpets and draperies.
		
		Gustave was born illegitimate in 1830, to Johanna Christiana Maria Barbara Hagenlocher and an unnamed father, in Stuttgart, Württemberg, Germany.  Five years later, Johanna Hagenlocher married Christian Herter (1807–1874), a skilled cabinetmaker. Gustave took his stepfather's surname, and later added the "e" to the end of his given name. His half-brother, Christian Augustus Ludwig Herter, was born in 1839. The boys followed their stepfather/father in the furniture-making trade. Gustave Herter came to New York City in 1848, and by 1858 was working under his own name. Christian was in New York by 1859, and joined his brother in the firm (renamed Herter Brothers) by 1864. The firm was at the forefront of the panoply of furnishing styles that preceded the Mission style: Renaissance Revival, Neo-Grec, Eastlake, the Aesthetic Movement, ebonized "Anglo-Japanese style" furnishings of the 1870s – 1880s for which the firm is best recognized today, and the wide range of furnishings in revival styles required for Gilded Age houses.
		
		阿斯彭研究所（Aspen Institute）又称阿斯本研究所，是一个国际性非营利组织和智库，成立于1949年，当时名为阿斯本人文研究所（Aspen Institute of Humanistic Studies）或阿斯彭人文研究所。该研究所总部位于华盛顿哥伦比亚特区。
		
		The institute was largely the creation of Walter Paepcke, a Chicago businessman who had become inspired by the Great Books program of Mortimer Adler at the University of Chicago. In 1945, Paepcke visited Bauhaus artist and architect Herbert Bayer, AIA, who had designed and built a Bauhaus-inspired minimalist home outside the decaying former mining town of Aspen, in the Roaring Fork Valley. Paepcke and Bayer envisioned a place where artists, leaders, thinkers, and musicians could gather. Shortly thereafter, while passing through Aspen on a hunting expedition, oil industry maverick Robert O. Anderson (soon to be founder and CEO of Atlantic Richfield) met with Bayer and shared in Paepcke's and Bayer's vision. In 1949, Paepcke organized a 20-day international celebration for the 200th birthday of German poet and philosopher Johann Wolfgang von Goethe. The celebration attracted over 2,000 attendees, including Albert Schweitzer, José Ortega y Gasset, Thornton Wilder, and Arthur Rubinstein.[
		
		萨克森-安哈尔特（Saxony--Anhalt）是德意志联邦共和国的一个州，州府在马格德堡。它与下萨克森州、勃兰登堡州、萨克森州和图林根州相邻 //
		
		地理
		萨克森-安哈尔特的北部是平原，这里的城市与北德的城市有着共同的历史关系，它们中有些是汉萨同盟的成员。中部是肥沃的马格德堡平原。西南部是哈茨山。南部靠近萨克森的边界上以哈雷为中心是一个重要的工业区（有“化学三角”之称）。萨克森-安哈尔特有两个重要的工业区，在南部从哈雷开始一直到萨克森州的莱比锡是德国历史上传统的重工业区，尤其以化工为主，其他工业如光学工业也是很著名的。中部以马格德堡为中心是另一个重要的工业区。马格德堡的优点是它交通方便。这座城市位于中欧东西交通要道之上，从巴黎通向华沙，甚至莫斯科的高速公路和铁路经过这里，从德国西部通向首都柏林的德国高速列车也通过此处。贯通中欧的中欧运河和从捷克既可以航行的易北河在这里相交。哈茨山区是德国的一个重要的国内旅游区。在两德统一的过程中，原东德的萨克森-安哈尔特州受到很大的经济冲击，一些过去东德重要的国营企业（如鲁纳石油提炼厂、罗伯特隆电子工业等）关闭，使萨克森-安哈尔特州许多人失业。萨克森-安哈尔特州是今天德国失业率比较高（2005年达20%）、负债也比较高的一个州，在德国联邦州中属于相对贫困州。
		
		马格德堡（Magdeburg）是德国萨克森-安哈尔特州的首府，该州仅次于哈雷的第二大城市，也是该州三个非县辖城市之一。马格德堡位于易北河畔，是基督教和天主教的主教教区首邑，拥有两所高等学府，马格德堡奥托·冯·格里克大学和马格德堡-施滕达尔应用科学大学。这个城市因曾经作为奥托一世的皇宫所在地而著名。奥托一世在962年建立神圣罗马帝国。2005，马格德堡举办了建市1200周年庆典。从语言学上讲，“Magdeburg”这个名字可以上溯到“Magadoburg”这个单词，意思可能是“Mächtige Burg”（强大的城堡）马格德堡是欧洲最重要的中世纪城市之一。神圣罗马帝国皇帝奥托一世在其大部分统治时间里都居住在这里，死后也葬于此地的主教座堂。发生在该城的重要事件包括：
		
		805年，在Diedenhof Capitulary里第一次提到了马格德堡。
		919年，亨利一世在马格德堡修筑工事以防御马扎尔人和斯拉夫人。
		929年，亨利一世安排自己的儿子奥托一世迎娶了Edward the Elder的女儿伊迪丝。在两人的婚礼上，伊迪丝收到了新婚礼物---马格德堡。伊迪丝对这座城市有着独特的喜爱并经常居住于此。937年，一个皇家聚会在马格德堡举行。同时，马格德堡主教座堂的前身圣莫里斯隐修院建立。946年，伊迪丝王后逝世并葬于修道院的地下室。
		968年，在拉韦纳宗教会议上，马格德堡总主教一职设立。总主教在德国对易北河东斯拉夫人土地的殖民过程中扮演了重要的角色。973年，奥托一世逝世并葬于马德格堡主教座堂。
		1035年，马格德堡获得了举办贸易展览和会议的特权，来自各国的游客开始集聚此的。
		1118年，马格德堡几乎被大火毁灭。
		十三世纪，马格德堡成为汉萨同盟的成员。在汉萨同盟期间，它与布鲁塞尔、安特卫普、科隆、纽伦堡、吕贝克、帕多瓦、曼托瓦、克雷莫纳、维罗纳、皮亚琴察、米兰、热那亚、佛罗伦萨、梅斯和斯特拉斯堡一同成为神圣罗马帝国中居民超过20,000的城市。马格德堡拥有一个自治的模式，称为Magdeburger Recht，后来被东欧的许多城市采用。马格德堡的市民坚持不懈地与主教斗争，到15世纪末，已基本独立于主教了。1524年，马丁·路德来到曾经就读过的马格德堡，开始鼓吹并促成该市叛离天主教。宗教改革在马格德堡迅速拥了一批信徒。
		神圣罗马帝国皇帝查理五世再次宣布已加入Alliance of Torgau和Schmalkadic League的马格德堡为非法，因为它没有接受神圣罗马帝国的“临时敕令”。在随后的几年中，马格德堡成为了新教的“堡垒”，也是第一个出版马丁·路德著作的城市。
		迪安·古德哈姆·艾奇逊（Dean Gooderham Acheson，1893年4月11日—1971年10月12日），生于康涅狄格州，美国律师、政治家，第51任美国国务卿，在其任内主导编写了《中美关系白皮书》。 1949年1月26日，艾奇逊发表声明，谓“美国对华政策不变”。1949年美国总统杜鲁门批准了由国务卿艾奇逊于国安会提出的一份秘密文件，指出小心隐藏美国将台湾从中国大陆的掌控中分离的愿景，交由联合国托管或小心推动台独或自治运动是对美国最好的结果。
		
		乔治·普拉特·舒尔茨（George Pratt Shultz，1920年—2021年），美国政治家。1920年12月13日，舒尔茨出生于纽约。1942年本科毕业于普林斯顿大学。二战期间服役于美国海军陆战队，任上尉。1949年获得麻省理工学院工业经济学博士学位。博士毕业后曾在麻省理工学院和芝加哥大学教经济学，之后曾任劳工部长、财政部长和国务卿。 Shultz was born December 13, 1920, in New York City, the only child of Margaret Lennox (née Pratt) and Birl Earl Shultz. He grew up in Englewood, New Jersey. His great-grandfather was an immigrant from Germany who arrived in the United States in the middle of the 19th century. Contrary to common assumption, Shultz was not a member of the Pratt family associated with John D. Rockefeller and the Standard Oil Trust.
		
		 His senior thesis, "The Agricultural Program of the Tennessee Valley Authority", examined the Tennessee Valley Authority's effect on local agriculture, for which he conducted on-site research.  He graduated with honors in 1942.  In 1957, Shultz left MIT and joined the University of Chicago Graduate School of Business as a professor of industrial relations, and he served as the Graduate School of Business Dean from 1962 to 1968.  During his time in Chicago, he was influenced by Nobel Laureates Milton Friedman and George Stigler, who reinforced Shultz's view of the importance of a free-market economy.  He left the University of Chicago to serve under President Richard Nixon in 1969
		
		In 1974, he left government service to become executive vice president of Bechtel Group, a large engineering and services company. He was later its president and a director. Under Shultz's leadership, Bechtel received contracts for many large construction projects, including from Saudi Arabia. In the year before he left Bechtel, the company reported a 50% increase in revenue.
		
		Secretary of State
		On July 16, 1982, Shultz was appointed by President Ronald Reagan as the 60th U.S. Secretary of State, replacing Alexander Haig, who had resigned. Shultz served for six and a half years, the longest tenure since Dean Rusk's. The possibility of a conflict of interest in his position as secretary of state after being in the upper management of the Bechtel Group was raised by several senators during his confirmation hearings. Shultz briefly lost his temper in response to some questions on the subject but was nevertheless unanimously confirmed by the Senate. Shultz relied primarily on the Foreign Service to formulate and implement Reagan's foreign policy. As reported in the State Department's official history, "by the summer of 1985, Shultz had personally selected most of the senior officials in the Department, emphasizing professional over political credentials in the process [...] The Foreign Service responded in kind by giving Shultz its 'complete support,' making him one of the most popular Secretaries since Dean Acheson."  Shultz's success came from not only the respect he earned from the bureaucracy but the strong relationship he forged with Reagan, who trusted him completely.
		
		Diplomatic historian Walter LaFeber states that his 1993 memoir, Turmoil and Triumph: My Years as Secretary of State, "is the most detailed, vivid, outspoken, and reliable record we probably shall have of the 1980s until the documents are opened" // 张爱萍出访美国，与他交过手，针锋相对，互不退让。 During the First Intifada (see Arab–Israeli conflict), Shultz "proposed ... an international convention in April 1988 ... on an interim autonomy agreement for the West Bank and Gaza Strip, to be implemented as of October for a three-year period". By December 1988, after six months of shuttle diplomacy, Shultz had established a diplomatic dialogue with the Palestine Liberation Organization, which was picked up by the next Administration.
		
		1971 ILWU strike
		On July 1, 1971, members of the International Longshore and Warehouse Union (ILWU) walked out against their employers, represented by the Pacific Maritime Association (PMA). The union's goal was to secure employment, wages, and benefits in the face of increased mechanization, shrinking workforce, and the slowing economic climate of the early 1970s. The strike shut down all 56 West coast ports, including those in Canada, and lasted 130 days, the longest strike in the ILWU's history //
		
		布莱恩·塞缪尔·爱普斯坦 // Brian Samuel Epstein，1934年—1967年 // 生于利物浦，犹太人，英国披头士乐队经纪人。他的经纪公司则根据他的家族音乐事业NEMS（North End Music Stores，北角音乐店），命名为NEMS Enterprises。
		
		Epstein's grandfather, Isaac Epstein, was Lithuanian-Jewish, arriving in Britain in the 1890s from what was then part of the Russian Empire at the age of eighteen.  His grandmother Dinah was the daughter of Joseph, a draper, and Esther Hyman, who had emigrated from Russia to Britain (circa 1871/72) with their eldest son Jacob. The Hymans had six other children. // Isaac Epstein married Dinah Hyman in Manchester in 1900.  In 1901, Isaac and Dinah were living at 80 Walton Road, Liverpool, with Isaac's sister Rachael Epstein, above the furniture dealership that he founded.  Dinah and Isaac's third child, Harry Epstein, would become Brian Epstein's father.
		
		Eventually the family moved to a larger home in the Anfield area of Liverpool at 27 Anfield Road. After Harry and his brother Leslie had joined the family firm, Isaac Epstein founded Epstein and Sons. He then enlarged the furniture business by taking over adjacent shops at 62/72 Walton Road to sell a range of other goods, such as musical instruments and household appliances. They called the expanding business NEMS (North End Music Stores), which offered lenient credit terms. Paul McCartney's father once bought a piano from them.[] Epstein's mother Malka (nicknamed "Queenie" by her family, as Malka means "queen" in Hebrew) was also involved in the Hyman furniture business, which also owned the Sheffield Veneering Company.

		The Rank Organisation (founded as J. Arthur Rank), was a British entertainment conglomerate founded by industrialist J. Arthur Rank in April 1937, Rank also served as the company chairman. It quickly became the largest and most vertically integrated film company in the United Kingdom, owning production, distribution and exhibition facilities as well as manufacturing projection equipment and chairs.[1] It also diversified into the manufacture of radios, TVs and photocopiers (as one of the owners of Rank Xerox). The company name lasted until February 1996, when the name and some of the remaining assets were absorbed into the newly structured Rank Group plc. The company itself became a wholly owned subsidiary of Xerox and was renamed XRO Limited in 1997. // The company logo, the Gongman, first used in 1935 by the group's distribution company General Film Distributors // and seen in the opening titles of the films, became a celebrated and enduring film emblem. The company founder J. Arthur Rank, born in Kingston upon Hull, UK, was already a wealthy industrialist through his father's flour milling business, Joseph Rank Ltd, before making his start in filmmaking by financing short religious subjects in line with his Methodist beliefs. As Rank was a Methodist Sunday School Teacher, he wished to introduce these beliefs to a wider audience.
		
		The Rank Organisation was established, as a means for Rank to consolidate his filmmaking interests, in 1937.[
		
		Jocasta Innes
		Jocasta Claire Traill Innes  (21 May 1934 – 20 April 2013) was a British writer, journalist and businesswoman. Innes was born in Nanjing, China, the eldest of three daughters born to Paul Joseph Anthony Innes, a Shell Oil executive and Alice Eileen née Traill, an Irish-Argentinian teacher who ran a school for the children of other British-born residents.  By the age of twelve she had lived on every continent in the world, except Antarctica. After a spell at a Coptic convent in Cairo, she was educated at Bedford High School from 1949 and Girton College, Cambridge, where she read Modern Languages. One of her first jobs was with the _Evening Standard_’s Londoners Diary, where she was known for the utterly charming way in which she gatecrashed the debutante balls that were diary fodder at the time. Her first book was the bestselling The Pauper's Cookbook[5] (1971), born as she said "out of necessity" during an impecunious spell. A self-taught cook, who idolised Elizabeth David, she was determined to show that making great food does not depend on buying expensive ingredients or having special expertise. This was followed by The Pauper’s Homemaking Book in 1976[] which took the same democratic approach to interiors and The Country Kitchen  which dealt with old-fashioned rural British cookery and crafts – Damson Cheese, curing hams in saltpetre and parsnip wine. //

His ancestors came from the region of Magdeburg in the state of Saxony-Anhalt, Germany. In his memoir, From Hiroshima to Glasnost, Paul Nitze describes how as a young boy he witnessed the outbreak of World War I while he was traveling in Germany with his father, mother, and sister, arriving in Munich just in time to be struck by the city crowds' patriotic enthusiasm for the imminent conflict.\n\nIn 1928 and 1929, the Chicago brokerage firm of Bacon, Whipple and Company sent Nitze to Europe. Upon his return, he heard Clarence Dillon predict the Great Depression and the decline of the importance of finance. Having attained financial independence through the sale to Revlon of his interest in a French laboratory producing pharmaceutical products in the United States, Nitze took an intellectual sabbatical that included a year of graduate study at Harvard in sociology, philosophy, and constitutional and international law. In 1929 he joined investment bank Dillon, Read & Co. where he remained until founding his own firm, P. H. Nitze & Co, in 1938. He returned to Dillon, Read as Vice-President from 1939 through to 1941. In 1932, he married Phyllis Pratt, daughter of John Teele Pratt, a Standard Oil financier, and of Ruth Baker Pratt, Republican Congresswoman for New York. She died in 1987. They had four children: Heidi, Peter, William, and Phyllis Anina (Nina). The journalist Nicholas Thompson, who wrote a biography of Nitze and George F. Kennan, is his grandson.  He was married to Elisabeth Scott Porter from 1993 until his death in 2004. Nitze's brother-in-law, Walter Paepcke, founded the Aspen Institute and Aspen Skiing Company. Nitze continued to ski in Aspen until well into his 80s.\n\nIn the early postwar era and Cold War, he served in the Truman Administration as Director of Policy Planning for the State Department (1950–1953). He was also the principal author in 1950 of the highly influential but secret National Security Council policy paper, NSC 68, which provided the strategic outline for increased US expenditures to counter the perceived threat of Soviet armament. During the Korean War, he advised the Truman administration against blaming the Soviet Union for the conflict too directly in order to avoid risking an escalation to World War III. From 1953 to 1961, Nitze served as president of the Foreign Service Educational Foundation while concurrently serving as associate of the Washington Center of Foreign Policy Research and the School of Advanced International Studies (SAIS) of the Johns Hopkins University. In 1956 he attended the Project Nobska anti-submarine warfare conference, where discussion ranged from oceanography to nuclear weapons. Nitze co-founded the School of Advanced International Studies (SAIS) with Christian Herter in 1943 and the world-renowned graduate school, based in Washington, D.C., is named in his honor. His publications during this period include U.S. Foreign Policy: 1945–1955. In 1961, President Kennedy appointed Nitze Assistant Secretary of Defense for International Security Affairs. In 1963, Nitze became the Secretary of the Navy, serving until 1967. According to the US Navy \"as the Navy secretary, he raised the level of attention given to quality of Service issues. His many achievements included establishing the first Personnel Policy Board and retention task force (the Alford Board), and obtaining targeted personnel bonuses. He lengthened commanding officer tours and raised command responsibility pay. Paul Nitze was a cofounder of Team B, a 1970s intelligence think tank that challenged the National Intelligence Estimates provided by the CIA. The Team B reports became the intellectual foundation for the idea of \"the window of vulnerability\" and of the massive arms buildup that began toward the end of the Carter administration and accelerated under President Ronald Reagan. Team B came to the conclusion that the Soviets had developed new weapons of mass destruction and had aggressive strategies with regard to a potential nuclear war. Team B's analysis of Soviet weapon systems was later believed to be largely exaggerated. According to Anne Cahn of the Arms Control and Disarmament Agency (1977–1980), \"if you go through most of Team B's specific allegations about weapons systems, and you just examine them one by one, they were all wrong.\" Nonetheless, some still claim that its conclusions about Soviet strategical aims were largely proven to be true, but this hardly squares with the elevation of Gorbachev in 1985.[11] Nitze was President Ronald Reagan's chief negotiator of the Intermediate-Range Nuclear Forces Treaty (1981–1984). In 1984, Nitze was named Special Advisor to the President and Secretary of State on Arms Control.\n\nFor more than forty years, Nitze was one of the chief architects of US policy toward the Soviet Union.\n\nI have been around at a time when important things needed to be done.\"\n\"One of the most dangerous forms of human error is forgetting what one is trying to achieve.\n莫蒂默·杰尔姆·阿德勒（Mortimer Jerome Adler，1902年—2001年）是一名美国哲学家。 阿德勒于1902年12月28日出生在美国纽约市的一个犹太移民家庭。14岁从中学辍学后，成为纽约太阳报的送稿人员，他当时立志想要成为一名记者 。不久，阿德勒开始在夜间学习写作课程，从中他发现以下作者堪称英雄:柏拉图、亚里斯多德、托马斯·阿奎那、约翰·洛克、约翰·斯图尔特·密尔等等。之后，他进入哥伦比亚大学继续学习，同时还向学生文艺杂志投稿。尽管由于没能通过必修的游泳测验，而没能获得学士学位（1983年，哥伦比亚大学授予了他一个荣誉学位以作为补偿），阿德勒还是留在了大学，最终得到了一个讲师的位置，并获得了心理学博士学位 。 1930年，阿德勒前往芝加哥大学，并由之前认识的朋友、新任校长罗伯特·梅纳德·哈钦斯安排为芝加哥大学法学院的法律哲学教授。然而他受到了芝加哥的一些哲学家的质疑，这些人对他“能否胜任哲学教授这个职责怀有重大疑问”，并且抵制阿德勒成为该大学哲学系的一分子。而同时，阿德勒也是该学校法学院有史以来第一个非律师出身的教师。\nAdler was born in Manhattan, New York City, on December 28, 1902, to Jewish immigrants from Germany: Clarissa (Manheim), a schoolteacher, and Ignatz Adler, a jewelry salesman.  He dropped out of school at age 14 to become a copy boy for the New York Sun, with the ultimate aspiration of becoming a journalist. Adler soon returned to school to take writing classes at night, where he discovered the western philosophical tradition. Encyclopedia and Educational Reform\nAdler and Hutchins went on to found the Great Books of the Western World program and the Great Books Foundation. In 1952, Adler founded and served as director of the Institute for Philosophical Research. He also served on the Board of Editors of Encyclopædia Britannica, compiled its Syntopicon and later Propaedia, and succeeded Hutchins as its chairman from 1974. As the director of editorial planning for the fifteenth edition of Britannica from 1965, he was instrumental in the major reorganization of knowledge embodied in that edition.  He introduced the Paideia Proposal which resulted in his founding the Paideia Program, a grade school curriculum centered around guided reading and discussion of difficult works (as judged for each grade). With Max Weismann, he founded the Center for the Study of the Great Ideas in 1990 in Chicago. Adler was born into a nonobservant Jewish family. In his early twenties, he discovered St. Thomas Aquinas, and in particular the Summa Theologica.  Many years later, he wrote that its \"intellectual austerity, integrity, precision and brilliance ... put the study of theology highest among all of my philosophical interests.\"  An enthusiastic Thomist, he was a frequent contributor to Catholic philosophical and educational journals, as well as a frequent speaker at Catholic institutions, so much so that some assumed he was a convert to Catholicism. But that was reserved for later. In 1940, James T. Farrell called Adler \"the leading American fellow-traveller of the Roman Catholic Church.\" What was true for Adler, Farrell said, was what was \"postulated in the dogma of the Roman Catholic Church,\" and he \"sang the same tune\" as avowed Catholic philosophers like Étienne Gilson, Jacques Maritain, and Martin D'Arcy. He also greatly admired Henri Bergson, the French Jewish philosopher and Nobel laureate, whose books the Catholic church had indexed as prohibited. Bergson refused to convert during the collaborationist Vichy regime, and despite the Statute on Jews he instead restated his previous views and was thus stripped of all his previous posts and honors.  Farrell attributed Adler's delay in joining the Church to his being among those Christians who \"wanted their cake and ... wanted to eat it too\" and compared him to the Emperor Constantine, who waited until he was on his deathbed to formally become a Catholic.\n\n罗杰·莫蒂默，第一代马奇伯爵（英语：Roger Mortimer，1st earl of March约1287年—1330年11月29日）英格兰贵族，第一代马奇伯爵（1328年起）和第八代威格莫尔男爵（1304年起）。在爱德华三世成年前，他曾是英格兰的真正统治者。\n\nA Marcher lord (Welsh: Barwn y Mers) was a noble appointed by the king of England to guard the border (known as the Welsh Marches) between England and Wales. A Marcher lord was the English equivalent of a margrave (in the Holy Roman Empire) or a marquis (in France) before the introduction of the title of \"marquess\" in Britain; no Marcher lord ever bore this rank. In this context the word march means a border region or frontier, and is cognate with the verb \"to march\", both ultimately derived from Proto-Indo-European *mereg-, \"edge\" or \"boundary\".\n\nThe greatest Marcher lords included the earls of Chester, Gloucester, Hereford, Pembroke and Shrewsbury (see also English earls of March).\n\nMarcher powers\nThe Anglo-Norman lordships in this area were distinct in several ways: they were geographically compact and jurisdictionally separate one from another, and they had special privileges which separated them from the usual English lordships. Royal writ did not work in the Marches: Marcher lords ruled their lands by their own law—sicut regale (\"like a king\") as Gilbert, Earl of Gloucester, stated,[1] whereas in England fief-holders were directly accountable to the king. Marcher lords could build castles, a jealously guarded and easily revoked Royal privilege in England. Marcher lords administered laws, waged war, established market towns, and maintained their own chanceries that kept their records (which have been completely lost). They had their own deputies, or sheriffs. Sitting in their own courts they had jurisdiction over all cases at law save high treason. \"They could establish forests and forest laws, declare and wage war, establish boroughs, and grant extensive charters of liberties. They could confiscate the estates of traitors and felons, and regrant these at will. They could establish and preside over their own petty parliaments and county courts. Finally, they could claim any and every feudal due, aid, grant, and relief\",  although they did not mint coins. Their one insecurity, if they did not take up arms against the king, was of dying without a legitimate heir, whereupon the title reverted to the Crown in escheat. Welsh law was frequently used in the Marches in preference to English law, and there would sometimes be a dispute as to which code should be used to decide a particular case.\n\nFeudal social structures, which were never fully established in England, took root in the Marches, which was not legally part of the realm of England. The traditional view has been that the Norman monarchy granted these outright. A revisionist view is that such rights were more common in the 11th century throughout the Conquest, but were largely suppressed in England, and survived in the Marches. Settlement was encouraged: knights were granted their own lands, which they held in feudal service to the Norman lords. Settlement was also encouraged in towns that were given market privileges, under the protection of a Norman keep. Peasants came to Wales in large numbers: Henry I encouraged Bretons, Flemings, Normans, and English settlers to move into the south of Wales.\n\nWhat happened to Roger Mortimer? In spite of Isabella's entreaty to her son, \"Fair son, have pity on the gentle Mortimer\", Mortimer was conveyed to the Tower. Accused of assuming royal power and of various other high misdemeanours, he was condemned without trial and hanged at Tyburn on 29 November 1330, his vast estates forfeited to the crown.\n\n克里斯蒂安·阿奇博尔德·赫脱（Christian Archibald Herter，1895年3月28日—1966年12月30日），美国政治家，生于法国巴黎，曾任马萨诸塞州州长、第53任美国国务卿和首任美国贸易代表，Albert Herter (March 2, 1871 – February 15, 1950) was an American painter, illustrator, muralist, and interior designer. He was born in New York City, studied at the Art Students League with James Carroll Beckwith, then in Paris with Jean-Paul Laurens and Fernand Cormon.\n\nHe came from an artistic family; his father, Christian Herter (1839–1883), had co-founded Herter Brothers, a prominent New York interior design and furnishings firm. Herter Brothers closed in 1906, and Albert founded Herter Looms in 1909, a tapestry and textile design-and-manufacturing firm that was, in a sense, successor to his father's firm. In Paris, he met a fellow American art student, Adele McGinnis. They were married in 1893 and had three children: Everit Albert (1894–1918), Christian Archibald (1895–1966), and Lydia Adele (1898–1951). The couple honeymooned in Japan, then returned to Paris for the first years of their marriage. In 1898 they moved back to the United States and built a Mediterranean-style villa, called \"Près Choisis\" (later called \"The Creeks\"), in East Hampton, New York, with a studio for each of them. Herter's mother built a mansion, \"El Mirasol,\" in Santa Barbara, California, where the family spent the winters. Following his mother's death, Herter and his wife renovated the mansion and converted it into a boutique hotel. Son Everit and daughter Lydia also became artists although Everit was killed at age 24 in World War I. Son Christian became a politician, serving as governor of Massachusetts and later U.S. Secretary of State under Dwight D. Eisenhower. Adele Herter was a founding member of New York City's Cosmopolitan Club, and is remembered as a painter of still lifes and \"Society\" portraits.\n\nThe firm of Herter Brothers, (working 1864–1906), was founded by German immigrants Gustave (1830–1898) and Christian Herter (1839–1883) in New York City. It began as a furniture and upholstery shop/warehouse, but after the Civil War became one of the first American firms to provide complete interior decoration services. With their own design office and cabinet-making and upholstery workshops, Herter Brothers could provide every aspect of interior furnishing—including decorative paneling, mantels, wall and ceiling decoration, patterned floors, carpets and draperies.\n\nGustave was born illegitimate in 1830, to Johanna Christiana Maria Barbara Hagenlocher and an unnamed father, in Stuttgart, Württemberg, Germany.  Five years later, Johanna Hagenlocher married Christian Herter (1807–1874), a skilled cabinetmaker. Gustave took his stepfather's surname, and later added the \"e\" to the end of his given name. His half-brother, Christian Augustus Ludwig Herter, was born in 1839. The boys followed their stepfather/father in the furniture-making trade. Gustave Herter came to New York City in 1848, and by 1858 was working under his own name. Christian was in New York by 1859, and joined his brother in the firm (renamed Herter Brothers) by 1864. The firm was at the forefront of the panoply of furnishing styles that preceded the Mission style: Renaissance Revival, Neo-Grec, Eastlake, the Aesthetic Movement, ebonized \"Anglo-Japanese style\" furnishings of the 1870s – 1880s for which the firm is best recognized today, and the wide range of furnishings in revival styles required for Gilded Age houses.\n\n阿斯彭研究所（Aspen Institute）又称阿斯本研究所，是一个国际性非营利组织和智库，成立于1949年，当时名为阿斯本人文研究所（Aspen Institute of Humanistic Studies）或阿斯彭人文研究所。该研究所总部位于华盛顿哥伦比亚特区。\n\nThe institute was largely the creation of Walter Paepcke, a Chicago businessman who had become inspired by the Great Books program of Mortimer Adler at the University of Chicago. In 1945, Paepcke visited Bauhaus artist and architect Herbert Bayer, AIA, who had designed and built a Bauhaus-inspired minimalist home outside the decaying former mining town of Aspen, in the Roaring Fork Valley. Paepcke and Bayer envisioned a place where artists, leaders, thinkers, and musicians could gather. Shortly thereafter, while passing through Aspen on a hunting expedition, oil industry maverick Robert O. Anderson (soon to be founder and CEO of Atlantic Richfield) met with Bayer and shared in Paepcke's and Bayer's vision. In 1949, Paepcke organized a 20-day international celebration for the 200th birthday of German poet and philosopher Johann Wolfgang von Goethe. The celebration attracted over 2,000 attendees, including Albert Schweitzer, José Ortega y Gasset, Thornton Wilder, and Arthur Rubinstein.[\n\n萨克森-安哈尔特（Saxony--Anhalt）是德意志联邦共和国的一个州，州府在马格德堡。它与下萨克森州、勃兰登堡州、萨克森州和图林根州相邻 //\n\n地理\n萨克森-安哈尔特的北部是平原，这里的城市与北德的城市有着共同的历史关系，它们中有些是汉萨同盟的成员。中部是肥沃的马格德堡平原。西南部是哈茨山。南部靠近萨克森的边界上以哈雷为中心是一个重要的工业区（有“化学三角”之称）。萨克森-安哈尔特有两个重要的工业区，在南部从哈雷开始一直到萨克森州的莱比锡是德国历史上传统的重工业区，尤其以化工为主，其他工业如光学工业也是很著名的。中部以马格德堡为中心是另一个重要的工业区。马格德堡的优点是它交通方便。这座城市位于中欧东西交通要道之上，从巴黎通向华沙，甚至莫斯科的高速公路和铁路经过这里，从德国西部通向首都柏林的德国高速列车也通过此处。贯通中欧的中欧运河和从捷克既可以航行的易北河在这里相交。哈茨山区是德国的一个重要的国内旅游区。在两德统一的过程中，原东德的萨克森-安哈尔特州受到很大的经济冲击，一些过去东德重要的国营企业（如鲁纳石油提炼厂、罗伯特隆电子工业等）关闭，使萨克森-安哈尔特州许多人失业。萨克森-安哈尔特州是今天德国失业率比较高（2005年达20%）、负债也比较高的一个州，在德国联邦州中属于相对贫困州。\n\n马格德堡（Magdeburg）是德国萨克森-安哈尔特州的首府，该州仅次于哈雷的第二大城市，也是该州三个非县辖城市之一。马格德堡位于易北河畔，是基督教和天主教的主教教区首邑，拥有两所高等学府，马格德堡奥托·冯·格里克大学和马格德堡-施滕达尔应用科学大学。这个城市因曾经作为奥托一世的皇宫所在地而著名。奥托一世在962年建立神圣罗马帝国。2005，马格德堡举办了建市1200周年庆典。从语言学上讲，“Magdeburg”这个名字可以上溯到“Magadoburg”这个单词，意思可能是“Mächtige Burg”（强大的城堡）马格德堡是欧洲最重要的中世纪城市之一。神圣罗马帝国皇帝奥托一世在其大部分统治时间里都居住在这里，死后也葬于此地的主教座堂。发生在该城的重要事件包括：\n\n805年，在Diedenhof Capitulary里第一次提到了马格德堡。\n919年，亨利一世在马格德堡修筑工事以防御马扎尔人和斯拉夫人。\n929年，亨利一世安排自己的儿子奥托一世迎娶了Edward the Elder的女儿伊迪丝。在两人的婚礼上，伊迪丝收到了新婚礼物---马格德堡。伊迪丝对这座城市有着独特的喜爱并经常居住于此。937年，一个皇家聚会在马格德堡举行。同时，马格德堡主教座堂的前身圣莫里斯隐修院建立。946年，伊迪丝王后逝世并葬于修道院的地下室。\n968年，在拉韦纳宗教会议上，马格德堡总主教一职设立。总主教在德国对易北河东斯拉夫人土地的殖民过程中扮演了重要的角色。973年，奥托一世逝世并葬于马德格堡主教座堂。\n1035年，马格德堡获得了举办贸易展览和会议的特权，来自各国的游客开始集聚此的。\n1118年，马格德堡几乎被大火毁灭。\n十三世纪，马格德堡成为汉萨同盟的成员。在汉萨同盟期间，它与布鲁塞尔、安特卫普、科隆、纽伦堡、吕贝克、帕多瓦、曼托瓦、克雷莫纳、维罗纳、皮亚琴察、米兰、热那亚、佛罗伦萨、梅斯和斯特拉斯堡一同成为神圣罗马帝国中居民超过20,000的城市。马格德堡拥有一个自治的模式，称为Magdeburger Recht，后来被东欧的许多城市采用。马格德堡的市民坚持不懈地与主教斗争，到15世纪末，已基本独立于主教了。1524年，马丁·路德来到曾经就读过的马格德堡，开始鼓吹并促成该市叛离天主教。宗教改革在马格德堡迅速拥了一批信徒。\n神圣罗马帝国皇帝查理五世再次宣布已加入Alliance of Torgau和Schmalkadic League的马格德堡为非法，因为它没有接受神圣罗马帝国的“临时敕令”。在随后的几年中，马格德堡成为了新教的“堡垒”，也是第一个出版马丁·路德著作的城市。\n迪安·古德哈姆·艾奇逊（Dean Gooderham Acheson，1893年4月11日—1971年10月12日），生于康涅狄格州，美国律师、政治家，第51任美国国务卿，在其任内主导编写了《中美关系白皮书》。 1949年1月26日，艾奇逊发表声明，谓“美国对华政策不变”。1949年美国总统杜鲁门批准了由国务卿艾奇逊于国安会提出的一份秘密文件，指出小心隐藏美国将台湾从中国大陆的掌控中分离的愿景，交由联合国托管或小心推动台独或自治运动是对美国最好的结果。\n\n乔治·普拉特·舒尔茨（George Pratt Shultz，1920年—2021年），美国政治家。1920年12月13日，舒尔茨出生于纽约。1942年本科毕业于普林斯顿大学。二战期间服役于美国海军陆战队，任上尉。1949年获得麻省理工学院工业经济学博士学位。博士毕业后曾在麻省理工学院和芝加哥大学教经济学，之后曾任劳工部长、财政部长和国务卿。 Shultz was born December 13, 1920, in New York City, the only child of Margaret Lennox (née Pratt) and Birl Earl Shultz. He grew up in Englewood, New Jersey. His great-grandfather was an immigrant from Germany who arrived in the United States in the middle of the 19th century. Contrary to common assumption, Shultz was not a member of the Pratt family associated with John D. Rockefeller and the Standard Oil Trust.\n\n His senior thesis, \"The Agricultural Program of the Tennessee Valley Authority\", examined the Tennessee Valley Authority's effect on local agriculture, for which he conducted on-site research.  He graduated with honors in 1942.  In 1957, Shultz left MIT and joined the University of Chicago Graduate School of Business as a professor of industrial relations, and he served as the Graduate School of Business Dean from 1962 to 1968.  During his time in Chicago, he was influenced by Nobel Laureates Milton Friedman and George Stigler, who reinforced Shultz's view of the importance of a free-market economy.  He left the University of Chicago to serve under President Richard Nixon in 1969\n\nIn 1974, he left government service to become executive vice president of Bechtel Group, a large engineering and services company. He was later its president and a director. Under Shultz's leadership, Bechtel received contracts for many large construction projects, including from Saudi Arabia. In the year before he left Bechtel, the company reported a 50% increase in revenue.\n\nSecretary of State\nOn July 16, 1982, Shultz was appointed by President Ronald Reagan as the 60th U.S. Secretary of State, replacing Alexander Haig, who had resigned. Shultz served for six and a half years, the longest tenure since Dean Rusk's. The possibility of a conflict of interest in his position as secretary of state after being in the upper management of the Bechtel Group was raised by several senators during his confirmation hearings. Shultz briefly lost his temper in response to some questions on the subject but was nevertheless unanimously confirmed by the Senate. Shultz relied primarily on the Foreign Service to formulate and implement Reagan's foreign policy. As reported in the State Department's official history, \"by the summer of 1985, Shultz had personally selected most of the senior officials in the Department, emphasizing professional over political credentials in the process [...] The Foreign Service responded in kind by giving Shultz its 'complete support,' making him one of the most popular Secretaries since Dean Acheson.\"  Shultz's success came from not only the respect he earned from the bureaucracy but the strong relationship he forged with Reagan, who trusted him completely.\n\nDiplomatic historian Walter LaFeber states that his 1993 memoir, Turmoil and Triumph: My Years as Secretary of State, \"is the most detailed, vivid, outspoken, and reliable record we probably shall have of the 1980s until the documents are opened\" // 张爱萍出访美国，与他交过手，针锋相对，互不退让。 During the First Intifada (see Arab–Israeli conflict), Shultz \"proposed ... an international convention in April 1988 ... on an interim autonomy agreement for the West Bank and Gaza Strip, to be implemented as of October for a three-year period\". By December 1988, after six months of shuttle diplomacy, Shultz had established a diplomatic dialogue with the Palestine Liberation Organization, which was picked up by the next Administration.\n\n1971 ILWU strike\nOn July 1, 1971, members of the International Longshore and Warehouse Union (ILWU) walked out against their employers, represented by the Pacific Maritime Association (PMA). The union's goal was to secure employment, wages, and benefits in the face of increased mechanization, shrinking workforce, and the slowing economic climate of the early 1970s. The strike shut down all 56 West coast ports, including those in Canada, and lasted 130 days, the longest strike in the ILWU's history //\n\n布莱恩·塞缪尔·爱普斯坦 // Brian Samuel Epstein，1934年—1967年 // 生于利物浦，犹太人，英国披头士乐队经纪人。他的经纪公司则根据他的家族音乐事业NEMS（North End Music Stores，北角音乐店），命名为NEMS Enterprises。\n\nEpstein's grandfather, Isaac Epstein, was Lithuanian-Jewish, arriving in Britain in the 1890s from what was then part of the Russian Empire at the age of eighteen.  His grandmother Dinah was the daughter of Joseph, a draper, and Esther Hyman, who had emigrated from Russia to Britain (circa 1871/72) with their eldest son Jacob. The Hymans had six other children. // Isaac Epstein married Dinah Hyman in Manchester in 1900.  In 1901, Isaac and Dinah were living at 80 Walton Road, Liverpool, with Isaac's sister Rachael Epstein, above the furniture dealership that he founded.  Dinah and Isaac's third child, Harry Epstein, would become Brian Epstein's father.\n\nEventually the family moved to a larger home in the Anfield area of Liverpool at 27 Anfield Road. After Harry and his brother Leslie had joined the family firm, Isaac Epstein founded Epstein and Sons. He then enlarged the furniture business by taking over adjacent shops at 62/72 Walton Road to sell a range of other goods, such as musical instruments and household appliances. They called the expanding business NEMS (North End Music Stores), which offered lenient credit terms. Paul McCartney's father once bought a piano from them.[] Epstein's mother Malka (nicknamed \"Queenie\" by her family, as Malka means \"queen\" in Hebrew) was also involved in the Hyman furniture business, which also owned the Sheffield Veneering Company.  Harry and Queenie married in 1933. In 2003, the family home on Anfield Road was converted into a Beatles-themed hotel called Epstein House.\n\n查尔斯·金（Charles King）是乔治城大学的国际事务和政府学教授，此前他曾担任埃德蒙·A·沃尔什外交服务学院的院长 // Charles King (born 1967) is the Professor of International Affairs and Government at Georgetown University, where he previously served as the chairman of the faculty of the Edmund A.

King won the Francis Parkman Prize for his 2019 book Gods of the Upper Air: How a Circle of Renegade Anthropologists Reinvented Race, Sex, and Gender in the Twentieth Century\n\nThe Rank Organisation (founded as J. Arthur Rank), was a British entertainment conglomerate founded by industrialist J. Arthur Rank in April 1937, Rank also served as the company chairman. It quickly became the largest and most vertically integrated film company in the United Kingdom, owning production, distribution and exhibition facilities as well as manufacturing projection equipment and chairs.[1] It also diversified into the manufacture of radios, TVs and photocopiers (as one of the owners of Rank Xerox). The company name lasted until February 1996, when the name and some of the remaining assets were absorbed into the newly structured Rank Group plc. The company itself became a wholly owned subsidiary of Xerox and was renamed XRO Limited in 1997. // The company logo, the Gongman, first used in 1935 by the group's distribution company General Film Distributors // and seen in the opening titles of the films, became a celebrated and enduring film emblem. The company founder J. Arthur Rank, born in Kingston upon Hull, UK, was already a wealthy industrialist through his father's flour milling business, Joseph Rank Ltd, before making his start in filmmaking by financing short religious subjects in line with his Methodist beliefs. As Rank was a Methodist Sunday School Teacher, he wished to introduce these beliefs to a wider audience.\n\nThe Rank Organisation was established, as a means for Rank to consolidate his filmmaking interests, in 1937.[\n\nJocasta Innes\nJocasta Claire Traill Innes  (21 May 1934 – 20 April 2013) was a British writer, journalist and businesswoman. Innes was born in Nanjing, China, the eldest of three daughters born to Paul Joseph Anthony Innes, a Shell Oil executive and Alice Eileen née Traill, an Irish-Argentinian teacher who ran a school for the children of other British-born residents.  By the age of twelve she had lived on every continent in the world, except Antarctica. After a spell at a Coptic convent in Cairo, she was educated at Bedford High School from 1949 and Girton College, Cambridge, where she read Modern Languages. One of her first jobs was with the _Evening Standard_’s Londoners Diary, where she was known for the utterly charming way in which she gatecrashed the debutante balls that were diary fodder at the time. Her first book was the bestselling The Pauper's Cookbook[5] (1971), born as she said \"out of necessity\" during an impecunious spell. A self-taught cook, who idolised Elizabeth David, she was determined to show that making great food does not depend on buying expensive ingredients or having special expertise. This was followed by The Pauper’s Homemaking Book in 1976[] which took the same democratic approach to interiors and The Country Kitchen  which dealt with old-fashioned rural British cookery and crafts – Damson Cheese, curing hams in saltpetre and parsnip wine. //\n\nRichard B.

His ancestors came from the region of Magdeburg in the state of Saxony-Anhalt, Germany. In his memoir, From Hiroshima to Glasnost, Paul Nitze describes how as a young boy he witnessed the outbreak of World War I while he was traveling in Germany with his father, mother, and sister, arriving in Munich just in time to be struck by the city crowds' patriotic enthusiasm for the imminent conflict.\n\nIn 1928 and 1929, the Chicago brokerage firm of Bacon, Whipple and Company sent Nitze to Europe. Upon his return, he heard Clarence Dillon predict the Great Depression and the decline of the importance of finance. Having attained financial independence through the sale to Revlon of his interest in a French laboratory producing pharmaceutical products in the United States, Nitze took an intellectual sabbatical that included a year of graduate study at Harvard in sociology, philosophy, and constitutional and international law. In 1929 he joined investment bank Dillon, Read & Co. where he remained until founding his own firm, P. H. Nitze & Co, in 1938. He returned to Dillon, Read as Vice-President from 1939 through to 1941. In 1932, he married Phyllis Pratt, daughter of John Teele Pratt, a Standard Oil financier, and of Ruth Baker Pratt, Republican Congresswoman for New York. She died in 1987. They had four children: Heidi, Peter, William, and Phyllis Anina (Nina). The journalist Nicholas Thompson, who wrote a biography of Nitze and George F. Kennan, is his grandson.  He was married to Elisabeth Scott Porter from 1993 until his death in 2004. Nitze's brother-in-law, Walter Paepcke, founded the Aspen Institute and Aspen Skiing Company. Nitze continued to ski in Aspen until well into his 80s.\n\nIn the early postwar era and Cold War, he served in the Truman Administration as Director of Policy Planning for the State Department (1950–1953). He was also the principal author in 1950 of the highly influential but secret National Security Council policy paper, NSC 68, which provided the strategic outline for increased US expenditures to counter the perceived threat of Soviet armament. During the Korean War, he advised the Truman administration against blaming the Soviet Union for the conflict too directly in order to avoid risking an escalation to World War III. From 1953 to 1961, Nitze served as president of the Foreign Service Educational Foundation while concurrently serving as associate of the Washington Center of Foreign Policy Research and the School of Advanced International Studies (SAIS) of the Johns Hopkins University. In 1956 he attended the Project Nobska anti-submarine warfare conference, where discussion ranged from oceanography to nuclear weapons. Nitze co-founded the School of Advanced International Studies (SAIS) with Christian Herter in 1943 and the world-renowned graduate school, based in Washington, D.C., is named in his honor. His publications during this period include U.S. Foreign Policy: 1945–1955. In 1961, President Kennedy appointed Nitze Assistant Secretary of Defense for International Security Affairs. In 1963, Nitze became the Secretary of the Navy, serving until 1967. According to the US Navy \"as the Navy secretary, he raised the level of attention given to quality of Service issues. His many achievements included establishing the first Personnel Policy Board and retention task force (the Alford Board), and obtaining targeted personnel bonuses. He lengthened commanding officer tours and raised command responsibility pay. Paul Nitze was a cofounder of Team B, a 1970s intelligence think tank that challenged the National Intelligence Estimates provided by the CIA. The Team B reports became the intellectual foundation for the idea of \"the window of vulnerability\" and of the massive arms buildup that began toward the end of the Carter administration and accelerated under President Ronald Reagan. Team B came to the conclusion that the Soviets had developed new weapons of mass destruction and had aggressive strategies with regard to a potential nuclear war. Team B's analysis of Soviet weapon systems was later believed to be largely exaggerated. According to Anne Cahn of the Arms Control and Disarmament Agency (1977–1980), \"if you go through most of Team B's specific allegations about weapons systems, and you just examine them one by one, they were all wrong.\" Nonetheless, some still claim that its conclusions about Soviet strategical aims were largely proven to be true, but this hardly squares with the elevation of Gorbachev in 1985.[11] Nitze was President Ronald Reagan's chief negotiator of the Intermediate-Range Nuclear Forces Treaty (1981–1984). In 1984, Nitze was named Special Advisor to the President and Secretary of State on Arms Control.\n\nFor more than forty years, Nitze was one of the chief architects of US policy toward the Soviet Union.\n\nI have been around at a time when important things needed to be done.\"\n\"One of the most dangerous forms of human error is forgetting what one is trying to achieve.\n莫蒂默·杰尔姆·阿德勒（Mortimer Jerome Adler，1902年—2001年）是一名美国哲学家。 阿德勒于1902年12月28日出生在美国纽约市的一个犹太移民家庭。14岁从中学辍学后，成为纽约太阳报的送稿人员，他当时立志想要成为一名记者 。不久，阿德勒开始在夜间学习写作课程，从中他发现以下作者堪称英雄:柏拉图、亚里斯多德、托马斯·阿奎那、约翰·洛克、约翰·斯图尔特·密尔等等。之后，他进入哥伦比亚大学继续学习，同时还向学生文艺杂志投稿。尽管由于没能通过必修的游泳测验，而没能获得学士学位（1983年，哥伦比亚大学授予了他一个荣誉学位以作为补偿），阿德勒还是留在了大学，最终得到了一个讲师的位置，并获得了心理学博士学位 。 1930年，阿德勒前往芝加哥大学，并由之前认识的朋友、新任校长罗伯特·梅纳德·哈钦斯安排为芝加哥大学法学院的法律哲学教授。然而他受到了芝加哥的一些哲学家的质疑，这些人对他“能否胜任哲学教授这个职责怀有重大疑问”，并且抵制阿德勒成为该大学哲学系的一分子。而同时，阿德勒也是该学校法学院有史以来第一个非律师出身的教师。\nAdler was born in Manhattan, New York City, on December 28, 1902, to Jewish immigrants from Germany: Clarissa (Manheim), a schoolteacher, and Ignatz Adler, a jewelry salesman.  He dropped out of school at age 14 to become a copy boy for the New York Sun, with the ultimate aspiration of becoming a journalist. Adler soon returned to school to take writing classes at night, where he discovered the western philosophical tradition. Encyclopedia and Educational Reform\nAdler and Hutchins went on to found the Great Books of the Western World program and the Great Books Foundation. In 1952, Adler founded and served as director of the Institute for Philosophical Research. He also served on the Board of Editors of Encyclopædia Britannica, compiled its Syntopicon and later Propaedia, and succeeded Hutchins as its chairman from 1974. As the director of editorial planning for the fifteenth edition of Britannica from 1965, he was instrumental in the major reorganization of knowledge embodied in that edition.  He introduced the Paideia Proposal which resulted in his founding the Paideia Program, a grade school curriculum centered around guided reading and discussion of difficult works (as judged for each grade). With Max Weismann, he founded the Center for the Study of the Great Ideas in 1990 in Chicago. Adler was born into a nonobservant Jewish family. In his early twenties, he discovered St. Thomas Aquinas, and in particular the Summa Theologica.  Many years later, he wrote that its \"intellectual austerity, integrity, precision and brilliance ... put the study of theology highest among all of my philosophical interests.\"  An enthusiastic Thomist, he was a frequent contributor to Catholic philosophical and educational journals, as well as a frequent speaker at Catholic institutions, so much so that some assumed he was a convert to Catholicism. But that was reserved for later. In 1940, James T. Farrell called Adler \"the leading American fellow-traveller of the Roman Catholic Church.\" What was true for Adler, Farrell said, was what was \"postulated in the dogma of the Roman Catholic Church,\" and he \"sang the same tune\" as avowed Catholic philosophers like Étienne Gilson, Jacques Maritain, and Martin D'Arcy. He also greatly admired Henri Bergson, the French Jewish philosopher and Nobel laureate, whose books the Catholic church had indexed as prohibited. Bergson refused to convert during the collaborationist Vichy regime, and despite the Statute on Jews he instead restated his previous views and was thus stripped of all his previous posts and honors.  Farrell attributed Adler's delay in joining the Church to his being among those Christians who \"wanted their cake and ... wanted to eat it too\" and compared him to the Emperor Constantine, who waited until he was on his deathbed to formally become a Catholic.\n\n罗杰·莫蒂默，第一代马奇伯爵（英语：Roger Mortimer，1st earl of March约1287年—1330年11月29日）英格兰贵族，第一代马奇伯爵（1328年起）和第八代威格莫尔男爵（1304年起）。在爱德华三世成年前，他曾是英格兰的真正统治者。\n\nA Marcher lord (Welsh: Barwn y Mers) was a noble appointed by the king of England to guard the border (known as the Welsh Marches) between England and Wales. A Marcher lord was the English equivalent of a margrave (in the Holy Roman Empire) or a marquis (in France) before the introduction of the title of \"marquess\" in Britain; no Marcher lord ever bore this rank. In this context the word march means a border region or frontier, and is cognate with the verb \"to march\", both ultimately derived from Proto-Indo-European *mereg-, \"edge\" or \"boundary\".\n\nThe greatest Marcher lords included the earls of Chester, Gloucester, Hereford, Pembroke and Shrewsbury (see also English earls of March).\n\nMarcher powers\nThe Anglo-Norman lordships in this area were distinct in several ways: they were geographically compact and jurisdictionally separate one from another, and they had special privileges which separated them from the usual English lordships. Royal writ did not work in the Marches: Marcher lords ruled their lands by their own law—sicut regale (\"like a king\") as Gilbert, Earl of Gloucester, stated,[1] whereas in England fief-holders were directly accountable to the king. Marcher lords could build castles, a jealously guarded and easily revoked Royal privilege in England. Marcher lords administered laws, waged war, established market towns, and maintained their own chanceries that kept their records (which have been completely lost). They had their own deputies, or sheriffs. Sitting in their own courts they had jurisdiction over all cases at law save high treason. \"They could establish forests and forest laws, declare and wage war, establish boroughs, and grant extensive charters of liberties. They could confiscate the estates of traitors and felons, and regrant these at will. They could establish and preside over their own petty parliaments and county courts. Finally, they could claim any and every feudal due, aid, grant, and relief\",  although they did not mint coins. Their one insecurity, if they did not take up arms against the king, was of dying without a legitimate heir, whereupon the title reverted to the Crown in escheat. Welsh law was frequently used in the Marches in preference to English law, and there would sometimes be a dispute as to which code should be used to decide a particular case.\n\nFeudal social structures, which were never fully established in England, took root in the Marches, which was not legally part of the realm of England. The traditional view has been that the Norman monarchy granted these outright. A revisionist view is that such rights were more common in the 11th century throughout the Conquest, but were largely suppressed in England, and survived in the Marches. Settlement was encouraged: knights were granted their own lands, which they held in feudal service to the Norman lords. Settlement was also encouraged in towns that were given market privileges, under the protection of a Norman keep. Peasants came to Wales in large numbers: Henry I encouraged Bretons, Flemings, Normans, and English settlers to move into the south of Wales.\n\nWhat happened to Roger Mortimer? In spite of Isabella's entreaty to her son, \"Fair son, have pity on the gentle Mortimer\", Mortimer was conveyed to the Tower. Accused of assuming royal power and of various other high misdemeanours, he was condemned without trial and hanged at Tyburn on 29 November 1330, his vast estates forfeited to the crown.\n\n克里斯蒂安·阿奇博尔德·赫脱（Christian Archibald Herter，1895年3月28日—1966年12月30日），美国政治家，生于法国巴黎，曾任马萨诸塞州州长、第53任美国国务卿和首任美国贸易代表，Albert Herter (March 2, 1871 – February 15, 1950) was an American painter, illustrator, muralist, and interior designer. He was born in New York City, studied at the Art Students League with James Carroll Beckwith, then in Paris with Jean-Paul Laurens and Fernand Cormon.\n\nHe came from an artistic family; his father, Christian Herter (1839–1883), had co-founded Herter Brothers, a prominent New York interior design and furnishings firm. Herter Brothers closed in 1906, and Albert founded Herter Looms in 1909, a tapestry and textile design-and-manufacturing firm that was, in a sense, successor to his father's firm. In Paris, he met a fellow American art student, Adele McGinnis. They were married in 1893 and had three children: Everit Albert (1894–1918), Christian Archibald (1895–1966), and Lydia Adele (1898–1951). The couple honeymooned in Japan, then returned to Paris for the first years of their marriage. In 1898 they moved back to the United States and built a Mediterranean-style villa, called \"Près Choisis\" (later called \"The Creeks\"), in East Hampton, New York, with a studio for each of them. Herter's mother built a mansion, \"El Mirasol,\" in Santa Barbara, California, where the family spent the winters. Following his mother's death, Herter and his wife renovated the mansion and converted it into a boutique hotel. Son Everit and daughter Lydia also became artists although Everit was killed at age 24 in World War I. Son Christian became a politician, serving as governor of Massachusetts and later U.S. Secretary of State under Dwight D. Eisenhower. Adele Herter was a founding member of New York City's Cosmopolitan Club, and is remembered as a painter of still lifes and \"Society\" portraits.\n\nThe firm of Herter Brothers, (working 1864–1906), was founded by German immigrants Gustave (1830–1898) and Christian Herter (1839–1883) in New York City. It began as a furniture and upholstery shop/warehouse, but after the Civil War became one of the first American firms to provide complete interior decoration services. With their own design office and cabinet-making and upholstery workshops, Herter Brothers could provide every aspect of interior furnishing—including decorative paneling, mantels, wall and ceiling decoration, patterned floors, carpets and draperies.\n\nGustave was born illegitimate in 1830, to Johanna Christiana Maria Barbara Hagenlocher and an unnamed father, in Stuttgart, Württemberg, Germany.  Five years later, Johanna Hagenlocher married Christian Herter (1807–1874), a skilled cabinetmaker. Gustave took his stepfather's surname, and later added the \"e\" to the end of his given name. His half-brother, Christian Augustus Ludwig Herter, was born in 1839. The boys followed their stepfather/father in the furniture-making trade. Gustave Herter came to New York City in 1848, and by 1858 was working under his own name. Christian was in New York by 1859, and joined his brother in the firm (renamed Herter Brothers) by 1864. The firm was at the forefront of the panoply of furnishing styles that preceded the Mission style: Renaissance Revival, Neo-Grec, Eastlake, the Aesthetic Movement, ebonized \"Anglo-Japanese style\" furnishings of the 1870s – 1880s for which the firm is best recognized today, and the wide range of furnishings in revival styles required for Gilded Age houses.\n\n阿斯彭研究所（Aspen Institute）又称阿斯本研究所，是一个国际性非营利组织和智库，成立于1949年，当时名为阿斯本人文研究所（Aspen Institute of Humanistic Studies）或阿斯彭人文研究所。该研究所总部位于华盛顿哥伦比亚特区。\n\nThe institute was largely the creation of Walter Paepcke, a Chicago businessman who had become inspired by the Great Books program of Mortimer Adler at the University of Chicago. In 1945, Paepcke visited Bauhaus artist and architect Herbert Bayer, AIA, who had designed and built a Bauhaus-inspired minimalist home outside the decaying former mining town of Aspen, in the Roaring Fork Valley. Paepcke and Bayer envisioned a place where artists, leaders, thinkers, and musicians could gather. Shortly thereafter, while passing through Aspen on a hunting expedition, oil industry maverick Robert O. Anderson (soon to be founder and CEO of Atlantic Richfield) met with Bayer and shared in Paepcke's and Bayer's vision. In 1949, Paepcke organized a 20-day international celebration for the 200th birthday of German poet and philosopher Johann Wolfgang von Goethe. The celebration attracted over 2,000 attendees, including Albert Schweitzer, José Ortega y Gasset, Thornton Wilder, and Arthur Rubinstein.[\n\n萨克森-安哈尔特（Saxony--Anhalt）是德意志联邦共和国的一个州，州府在马格德堡。它与下萨克森州、勃兰登堡州、萨克森州和图林根州相邻 //\n\n地理\n萨克森-安哈尔特的北部是平原，这里的城市与北德的城市有着共同的历史关系，它们中有些是汉萨同盟的成员。中部是肥沃的马格德堡平原。西南部是哈茨山。南部靠近萨克森的边界上以哈雷为中心是一个重要的工业区（有“化学三角”之称）。萨克森-安哈尔特有两个重要的工业区，在南部从哈雷开始一直到萨克森州的莱比锡是德国历史上传统的重工业区，尤其以化工为主，其他工业如光学工业也是很著名的。中部以马格德堡为中心是另一个重要的工业区。马格德堡的优点是它交通方便。这座城市位于中欧东西交通要道之上，从巴黎通向华沙，甚至莫斯科的高速公路和铁路经过这里，从德国西部通向首都柏林的德国高速列车也通过此处。贯通中欧的中欧运河和从捷克既可以航行的易北河在这里相交。哈茨山区是德国的一个重要的国内旅游区。在两德统一的过程中，原东德的萨克森-安哈尔特州受到很大的经济冲击，一些过去东德重要的国营企业（如鲁纳石油提炼厂、罗伯特隆电子工业等）关闭，使萨克森-安哈尔特州许多人失业。萨克森-安哈尔特州是今天德国失业率比较高（2005年达20%）、负债也比较高的一个州，在德国联邦州中属于相对贫困州。\n\n马格德堡（Magdeburg）是德国萨克森-安哈尔特州的首府，该州仅次于哈雷的第二大城市，也是该州三个非县辖城市之一。马格德堡位于易北河畔，是基督教和天主教的主教教区首邑，拥有两所高等学府，马格德堡奥托·冯·格里克大学和马格德堡-施滕达尔应用科学大学。这个城市因曾经作为奥托一世的皇宫所在地而著名。奥托一世在962年建立神圣罗马帝国。2005，马格德堡举办了建市1200周年庆典。从语言学上讲，“Magdeburg”这个名字可以上溯到“Magadoburg”这个单词，意思可能是“Mächtige Burg”（强大的城堡）马格德堡是欧洲最重要的中世纪城市之一。神圣罗马帝国皇帝奥托一世在其大部分统治时间里都居住在这里，死后也葬于此地的主教座堂。发生在该城的重要事件包括：\n\n805年，在Diedenhof Capitulary里第一次提到了马格德堡。\n919年，亨利一世在马格德堡修筑工事以防御马扎尔人和斯拉夫人。\n929年，亨利一世安排自己的儿子奥托一世迎娶了Edward the Elder的女儿伊迪丝。在两人的婚礼上，伊迪丝收到了新婚礼物---马格德堡。伊迪丝对这座城市有着独特的喜爱并经常居住于此。937年，一个皇家聚会在马格德堡举行。同时，马格德堡主教座堂的前身圣莫里斯隐修院建立。946年，伊迪丝王后逝世并葬于修道院的地下室。\n968年，在拉韦纳宗教会议上，马格德堡总主教一职设立。总主教在德国对易北河东斯拉夫人土地的殖民过程中扮演了重要的角色。973年，奥托一世逝世并葬于马德格堡主教座堂。\n1035年，马格德堡获得了举办贸易展览和会议的特权，来自各国的游客开始集聚此的。\n1118年，马格德堡几乎被大火毁灭。\n十三世纪，马格德堡成为汉萨同盟的成员。在汉萨同盟期间，它与布鲁塞尔、安特卫普、科隆、纽伦堡、吕贝克、帕多瓦、曼托瓦、克雷莫纳、维罗纳、皮亚琴察、米兰、热那亚、佛罗伦萨、梅斯和斯特拉斯堡一同成为神圣罗马帝国中居民超过20,000的城市。马格德堡拥有一个自治的模式，称为Magdeburger Recht，后来被东欧的许多城市采用。马格德堡的市民坚持不懈地与主教斗争，到15世纪末，已基本独立于主教了。1524年，马丁·路德来到曾经就读过的马格德堡，开始鼓吹并促成该市叛离天主教。宗教改革在马格德堡迅速拥了一批信徒。\n神圣罗马帝国皇帝查理五世再次宣布已加入Alliance of Torgau和Schmalkadic League的马格德堡为非法，因为它没有接受神圣罗马帝国的“临时敕令”。在随后的几年中，马格德堡成为了新教的“堡垒”，也是第一个出版马丁·路德著作的城市。\n迪安·古德哈姆·艾奇逊（Dean Gooderham Acheson，1893年4月11日—1971年10月12日），生于康涅狄格州，美国律师、政治家，第51任美国国务卿，在其任内主导编写了《中美关系白皮书》。 1949年1月26日，艾奇逊发表声明，谓“美国对华政策不变”。1949年美国总统杜鲁门批准了由国务卿艾奇逊于国安会提出的一份秘密文件，指出小心隐藏美国将台湾从中国大陆的掌控中分离的愿景，交由联合国托管或小心推动台独或自治运动是对美国最好的结果。\n\n乔治·普拉特·舒尔茨（George Pratt Shultz，1920年—2021年），美国政治家。1920年12月13日，舒尔茨出生于纽约。1942年本科毕业于普林斯顿大学。二战期间服役于美国海军陆战队，任上尉。1949年获得麻省理工学院工业经济学博士学位。博士毕业后曾在麻省理工学院和芝加哥大学教经济学，之后曾任劳工部长、财政部长和国务卿。 Shultz was born December 13, 1920, in New York City, the only child of Margaret Lennox (née Pratt) and Birl Earl Shultz. He grew up in Englewood, New Jersey. His great-grandfather was an immigrant from Germany who arrived in the United States in the middle of the 19th century. Contrary to common assumption, Shultz was not a member of the Pratt family associated with John D. Rockefeller and the Standard Oil Trust.\n\n His senior thesis, \"The Agricultural Program of the Tennessee Valley Authority\", examined the Tennessee Valley Authority's effect on local agriculture, for which he conducted on-site research.  He graduated with honors in 1942.  In 1957, Shultz left MIT and joined the University of Chicago Graduate School of Business as a professor of industrial relations, and he served as the Graduate School of Business Dean from 1962 to 1968.  During his time in Chicago, he was influenced by Nobel Laureates Milton Friedman and George Stigler, who reinforced Shultz's view of the importance of a free-market economy.  He left the University of Chicago to serve under President Richard Nixon in 1969\n\nIn 1974, he left government service to become executive vice president of Bechtel Group, a large engineering and services company. He was later its president and a director. Under Shultz's leadership, Bechtel received contracts for many large construction projects, including from Saudi Arabia. In the year before he left Bechtel, the company reported a 50% increase in revenue.\n\nSecretary of State\nOn July 16, 1982, Shultz was appointed by President Ronald Reagan as the 60th U.S. Secretary of State, replacing Alexander Haig, who had resigned. Shultz served for six and a half years, the longest tenure since Dean Rusk's. The possibility of a conflict of interest in his position as secretary of state after being in the upper management of the Bechtel Group was raised by several senators during his confirmation hearings. Shultz briefly lost his temper in response to some questions on the subject but was nevertheless unanimously confirmed by the Senate. Shultz relied primarily on the Foreign Service to formulate and implement Reagan's foreign policy. As reported in the State Department's official history, \"by the summer of 1985, Shultz had personally selected most of the senior officials in the Department, emphasizing professional over political credentials in the process [...] The Foreign Service responded in kind by giving Shultz its 'complete support,' making him one of the most popular Secretaries since Dean Acheson.\"  Shultz's success came from not only the respect he earned from the bureaucracy but the strong relationship he forged with Reagan, who trusted him completely.\n\nDiplomatic historian Walter LaFeber states that his 1993 memoir, Turmoil and Triumph: My Years as Secretary of State, \"is the most detailed, vivid, outspoken, and reliable record we probably shall have of the 1980s until the documents are opened\" // 张爱萍出访美国，与他交过手，针锋相对，互不退让。 During the First Intifada (see Arab–Israeli conflict), Shultz \"proposed ... an international convention in April 1988 ... on an interim autonomy agreement for the West Bank and Gaza Strip, to be implemented as of October for a three-year period\". By December 1988, after six months of shuttle diplomacy, Shultz had established a diplomatic dialogue with the Palestine Liberation Organization, which was picked up by the next Administration.\n\n1971 ILWU strike\nOn July 1, 1971, members of the International Longshore and Warehouse Union (ILWU) walked out against their employers, represented by the Pacific Maritime Association (PMA). The union's goal was to secure employment, wages, and benefits in the face of increased mechanization, shrinking workforce, and the slowing economic climate of the early 1970s. The strike shut down all 56 West coast ports, including those in Canada, and lasted 130 days, the longest strike in the ILWU's history //\n\n布莱恩·塞缪尔·爱普斯坦 // Brian Samuel Epstein，1934年—1967年 // 生于利物浦，犹太人，英国披头士乐队经纪人。他的经纪公司则根据他的家族音乐事业NEMS（North End Music Stores，北角音乐店），命名为NEMS Enterprises。\n\nEpstein's grandfather, Isaac Epstein, was Lithuanian-Jewish, arriving in Britain in the 1890s from what was then part of the Russian Empire at the age of eighteen.  His grandmother Dinah was the daughter of Joseph, a draper, and Esther Hyman, who had emigrated from Russia to Britain (circa 1871/72) with their eldest son Jacob. The Hymans had six other children. // Isaac Epstein married Dinah Hyman in Manchester in 1900.  In 1901, Isaac and Dinah were living at 80 Walton Road, Liverpool, with Isaac's sister Rachael Epstein, above the furniture dealership that he founded.  Dinah and Isaac's third child, Harry Epstein, would become Brian Epstein's father.\n\nEventually the family moved to a larger home in the Anfield area of Liverpool at 27 Anfield Road. After Harry and his brother Leslie had joined the family firm, Isaac Epstein founded Epstein and Sons. He then enlarged the furniture business by taking over adjacent shops at 62/72 Walton Road to sell a range of other goods, such as musical instruments and household appliances. They called the expanding business NEMS (North End Music Stores), which offered lenient credit terms. Paul McCartney's father once bought a piano from them.[] Epstein's mother Malka (nicknamed \"Queenie\" by her family, as Malka means \"queen\" in Hebrew) was also involved in the Hyman furniture business, which also owned the Sheffield Veneering Company.  Harry and Queenie married in 1933. In 2003, the family home on Anfield Road was converted into a Beatles-themed hotel called Epstein House.\n\n查尔斯·金（Charles King）是乔治城大学的国际事务和政府学教授，此前他曾担任埃德蒙·A·沃尔什外交服务学院的院长 // Charles King (born 1967) is the Professor of International Affairs and Government at Georgetown University, where he previously served as the chairman of the faculty of the Edmund A. Walsh School of Foreign Service // A former Marshall scholar and Fulbright scholar, King holds a B.A. in history and B.A. in philosophy, both awarded summa cum laude from the University of Arkansas. He holds a M.Phil. in Russian and east European studies and a D.Phil. in politics from Oxford University where he was a Marshall Scholar.

King won the Francis Parkman Prize for his 2019 book Gods of the Upper Air: How a Circle of Renegade Anthropologists Reinvented Race, Sex, and Gender in the Twentieth Century\n\nThe Rank Organisation (founded as J. Arthur Rank), was a British entertainment conglomerate founded by industrialist J. Arthur Rank in April 1937, Rank also served as the company chairman. It quickly became the largest and most vertically integrated film company in the United Kingdom, owning production, distribution and exhibition facilities as well as manufacturing projection equipment and chairs.[1] It also diversified into the manufacture of radios, TVs and photocopiers (as one of the owners of Rank Xerox). The company name lasted until February 1996, when the name and some of the remaining assets were absorbed into the newly structured Rank Group plc. The company itself became a wholly owned subsidiary of Xerox and was renamed XRO Limited in 1997. // The company logo, the Gongman, first used in 1935 by the group's distribution company General Film Distributors // and seen in the opening titles of the films, became a celebrated and enduring film emblem. The company founder J. Arthur Rank, born in Kingston upon Hull, UK, was already a wealthy industrialist through his father's flour milling business, Joseph Rank Ltd, before making his start in filmmaking by financing short religious subjects in line with his Methodist beliefs. As Rank was a Methodist Sunday School Teacher, he wished to introduce these beliefs to a wider audience.\n\nThe Rank Organisation was established, as a means for Rank to consolidate his filmmaking interests, in 1937.[\n\nJocasta Innes\nJocasta Claire Traill Innes  (21 May 1934 – 20 April 2013) was a British writer, journalist and businesswoman. Innes was born in Nanjing, China, the eldest of three daughters born to Paul Joseph Anthony Innes, a Shell Oil executive and Alice Eileen née Traill, an Irish-Argentinian teacher who ran a school for the children of other British-born residents.  By the age of twelve she had lived on every continent in the world, except Antarctica. After a spell at a Coptic convent in Cairo, she was educated at Bedford High School from 1949 and Girton College, Cambridge, where she read Modern Languages. One of her first jobs was with the _Evening Standard_’s Londoners Diary, where she was known for the utterly charming way in which she gatecrashed the debutante balls that were diary fodder at the time. Her first book was the bestselling The Pauper's Cookbook[5] (1971), born as she said \"out of necessity\" during an impecunious spell. A self-taught cook, who idolised Elizabeth David, she was determined to show that making great food does not depend on buying expensive ingredients or having special expertise. This was followed by The Pauper’s Homemaking Book in 1976[] which took the same democratic approach to interiors and The Country Kitchen  which dealt with old-fashioned rural British cookery and crafts – Damson Cheese, curing hams in saltpetre and parsnip wine. //\n\nRichard B.

His ancestors came from the region of Magdeburg in the state of Saxony-Anhalt, Germany. In his memoir, From Hiroshima to Glasnost, Paul Nitze describes how as a young boy he witnessed the outbreak of World War I while he was traveling in Germany with his father, mother, and sister, arriving in Munich just in time to be struck by the city crowds' patriotic enthusiasm for the imminent conflict.\n\nIn 1928 and 1929, the Chicago brokerage firm of Bacon, Whipple and Company sent Nitze to Europe. Upon his return, he heard Clarence Dillon predict the Great Depression and the decline of the importance of finance. Having attained financial independence through the sale to Revlon of his interest in a French laboratory producing pharmaceutical products in the United States, Nitze took an intellectual sabbatical that included a year of graduate study at Harvard in sociology, philosophy, and constitutional and international law. In 1929 he joined investment bank Dillon, Read & Co. where he remained until founding his own firm, P. H. Nitze & Co, in 1938. He returned to Dillon, Read as Vice-President from 1939 through to 1941. In 1932, he married Phyllis Pratt, daughter of John Teele Pratt, a Standard Oil financier, and of Ruth Baker Pratt, Republican Congresswoman for New York. She died in 1987. They had four children: Heidi, Peter, William, and Phyllis Anina (Nina). The journalist Nicholas Thompson, who wrote a biography of Nitze and George F. Kennan, is his grandson.  He was married to Elisabeth Scott Porter from 1993 until his death in 2004. Nitze's brother-in-law, Walter Paepcke, founded the Aspen Institute and Aspen Skiing Company. Nitze continued to ski in Aspen until well into his 80s.\n\nIn the early postwar era and Cold War, he served in the Truman Administration as Director of Policy Planning for the State Department (1950–1953). He was also the principal author in 1950 of the highly influential but secret National Security Council policy paper, NSC 68, which provided the strategic outline for increased US expenditures to counter the perceived threat of Soviet armament. During the Korean War, he advised the Truman administration against blaming the Soviet Union for the conflict too directly in order to avoid risking an escalation to World War III. From 1953 to 1961, Nitze served as president of the Foreign Service Educational Foundation while concurrently serving as associate of the Washington Center of Foreign Policy Research and the School of Advanced International Studies (SAIS) of the Johns Hopkins University. In 1956 he attended the Project Nobska anti-submarine warfare conference, where discussion ranged from oceanography to nuclear weapons. Nitze co-founded the School of Advanced International Studies (SAIS) with Christian Herter in 1943 and the world-renowned graduate school, based in Washington, D.C., is named in his honor. His publications during this period include U.S. Foreign Policy: 1945–1955. In 1961, President Kennedy appointed Nitze Assistant Secretary of Defense for International Security Affairs. In 1963, Nitze became the Secretary of the Navy, serving until 1967. According to the US Navy \"as the Navy secretary, he raised the level of attention given to quality of Service issues. His many achievements included establishing the first Personnel Policy Board and retention task force (the Alford Board), and obtaining targeted personnel bonuses. He lengthened commanding officer tours and raised command responsibility pay. Paul Nitze was a cofounder of Team B, a 1970s intelligence think tank that challenged the National Intelligence Estimates provided by the CIA. The Team B reports became the intellectual foundation for the idea of \"the window of vulnerability\" and of the massive arms buildup that began toward the end of the Carter administration and accelerated under President Ronald Reagan. Team B came to the conclusion that the Soviets had developed new weapons of mass destruction and had aggressive strategies with regard to a potential nuclear war. Team B's analysis of Soviet weapon systems was later believed to be largely exaggerated. According to Anne Cahn of the Arms Control and Disarmament Agency (1977–1980), \"if you go through most of Team B's specific allegations about weapons systems, and you just examine them one by one, they were all wrong.\" Nonetheless, some still claim that its conclusions about Soviet strategical aims were largely proven to be true, but this hardly squares with the elevation of Gorbachev in 1985.[11] Nitze was President Ronald Reagan's chief negotiator of the Intermediate-Range Nuclear Forces Treaty (1981–1984). In 1984, Nitze was named Special Advisor to the President and Secretary of State on Arms Control.\n\nFor more than forty years, Nitze was one of the chief architects of US policy toward the Soviet Union.\n\nI have been around at a time when important things needed to be done.\"\n\"One of the most dangerous forms of human error is forgetting what one is trying to achieve.\n莫蒂默·杰尔姆·阿德勒（Mortimer Jerome Adler，1902年—2001年）是一名美国哲学家。 阿德勒于1902年12月28日出生在美国纽约市的一个犹太移民家庭。14岁从中学辍学后，成为纽约太阳报的送稿人员，他当时立志想要成为一名记者 。不久，阿德勒开始在夜间学习写作课程，从中他发现以下作者堪称英雄:柏拉图、亚里斯多德、托马斯·阿奎那、约翰·洛克、约翰·斯图尔特·密尔等等。之后，他进入哥伦比亚大学继续学习，同时还向学生文艺杂志投稿。尽管由于没能通过必修的游泳测验，而没能获得学士学位（1983年，哥伦比亚大学授予了他一个荣誉学位以作为补偿），阿德勒还是留在了大学，最终得到了一个讲师的位置，并获得了心理学博士学位 。 1930年，阿德勒前往芝加哥大学，并由之前认识的朋友、新任校长罗伯特·梅纳德·哈钦斯安排为芝加哥大学法学院的法律哲学教授。然而他受到了芝加哥的一些哲学家的质疑，这些人对他“能否胜任哲学教授这个职责怀有重大疑问”，并且抵制阿德勒成为该大学哲学系的一分子。而同时，阿德勒也是该学校法学院有史以来第一个非律师出身的教师。\nAdler was born in Manhattan, New York City, on December 28, 1902, to Jewish immigrants from Germany: Clarissa (Manheim), a schoolteacher, and Ignatz Adler, a jewelry salesman.  He dropped out of school at age 14 to become a copy boy for the New York Sun, with the ultimate aspiration of becoming a journalist. Adler soon returned to school to take writing classes at night, where he discovered the western philosophical tradition. Encyclopedia and Educational Reform\nAdler and Hutchins went on to found the Great Books of the Western World program and the Great Books Foundation. In 1952, Adler founded and served as director of the Institute for Philosophical Research. He also served on the Board of Editors of Encyclopædia Britannica, compiled its Syntopicon and later Propaedia, and succeeded Hutchins as its chairman from 1974. As the director of editorial planning for the fifteenth edition of Britannica from 1965, he was instrumental in the major reorganization of knowledge embodied in that edition.  He introduced the Paideia Proposal which resulted in his founding the Paideia Program, a grade school curriculum centered around guided reading and discussion of difficult works (as judged for each grade). With Max Weismann, he founded the Center for the Study of the Great Ideas in 1990 in Chicago. Adler was born into a nonobservant Jewish family. In his early twenties, he discovered St. Thomas Aquinas, and in particular the Summa Theologica.  Many years later, he wrote that its \"intellectual austerity, integrity, precision and brilliance ... put the study of theology highest among all of my philosophical interests.\"  An enthusiastic Thomist, he was a frequent contributor to Catholic philosophical and educational journals, as well as a frequent speaker at Catholic institutions, so much so that some assumed he was a convert to Catholicism. But that was reserved for later. In 1940, James T. Farrell called Adler \"the leading American fellow-traveller of the Roman Catholic Church.\" What was true for Adler, Farrell said, was what was \"postulated in the dogma of the Roman Catholic Church,\" and he \"sang the same tune\" as avowed Catholic philosophers like Étienne Gilson, Jacques Maritain, and Martin D'Arcy. He also greatly admired Henri Bergson, the French Jewish philosopher and Nobel laureate, whose books the Catholic church had indexed as prohibited. Bergson refused to convert during the collaborationist Vichy regime, and despite the Statute on Jews he instead restated his previous views and was thus stripped of all his previous posts and honors.  Farrell attributed Adler's delay in joining the Church to his being among those Christians who \"wanted their cake and ... wanted to eat it too\" and compared him to the Emperor Constantine, who waited until he was on his deathbed to formally become a Catholic.\n\n罗杰·莫蒂默，第一代马奇伯爵（英语：Roger Mortimer，1st earl of March约1287年—1330年11月29日）英格兰贵族，第一代马奇伯爵（1328年起）和第八代威格莫尔男爵（1304年起）。在爱德华三世成年前，他曾是英格兰的真正统治者。\n\nA Marcher lord (Welsh: Barwn y Mers) was a noble appointed by the king of England to guard the border (known as the Welsh Marches) between England and Wales. A Marcher lord was the English equivalent of a margrave (in the Holy Roman Empire) or a marquis (in France) before the introduction of the title of \"marquess\" in Britain; no Marcher lord ever bore this rank. In this context the word march means a border region or frontier, and is cognate with the verb \"to march\", both ultimately derived from Proto-Indo-European *mereg-, \"edge\" or \"boundary\".\n\nThe greatest Marcher lords included the earls of Chester, Gloucester, Hereford, Pembroke and Shrewsbury (see also English earls of March).\n\nMarcher powers\nThe Anglo-Norman lordships in this area were distinct in several ways: they were geographically compact and jurisdictionally separate one from another, and they had special privileges which separated them from the usual English lordships. Royal writ did not work in the Marches: Marcher lords ruled their lands by their own law—sicut regale (\"like a king\") as Gilbert, Earl of Gloucester, stated,[1] whereas in England fief-holders were directly accountable to the king. Marcher lords could build castles, a jealously guarded and easily revoked Royal privilege in England. Marcher lords administered laws, waged war, established market towns, and maintained their own chanceries that kept their records (which have been completely lost). They had their own deputies, or sheriffs. Sitting in their own courts they had jurisdiction over all cases at law save high treason. \"They could establish forests and forest laws, declare and wage war, establish boroughs, and grant extensive charters of liberties. They could confiscate the estates of traitors and felons, and regrant these at will. They could establish and preside over their own petty parliaments and county courts. Finally, they could claim any and every feudal due, aid, grant, and relief\",  although they did not mint coins. Their one insecurity, if they did not take up arms against the king, was of dying without a legitimate heir, whereupon the title reverted to the Crown in escheat. Welsh law was frequently used in the Marches in preference to English law, and there would sometimes be a dispute as to which code should be used to decide a particular case.\n\nFeudal social structures, which were never fully established in England, took root in the Marches, which was not legally part of the realm of England. The traditional view has been that the Norman monarchy granted these outright. A revisionist view is that such rights were more common in the 11th century throughout the Conquest, but were largely suppressed in England, and survived in the Marches. Settlement was encouraged: knights were granted their own lands, which they held in feudal service to the Norman lords. Settlement was also encouraged in towns that were given market privileges, under the protection of a Norman keep. Peasants came to Wales in large numbers: Henry I encouraged Bretons, Flemings, Normans, and English settlers to move into the south of Wales.\n\nWhat happened to Roger Mortimer? In spite of Isabella's entreaty to her son, \"Fair son, have pity on the gentle Mortimer\", Mortimer was conveyed to the Tower. Accused of assuming royal power and of various other high misdemeanours, he was condemned without trial and hanged at Tyburn on 29 November 1330, his vast estates forfeited to the crown.\n\n克里斯蒂安·阿奇博尔德·赫脱（Christian Archibald Herter，1895年3月28日—1966年12月30日），美国政治家，生于法国巴黎，曾任马萨诸塞州州长、第53任美国国务卿和首任美国贸易代表，Albert Herter (March 2, 1871 – February 15, 1950) was an American painter, illustrator, muralist, and interior designer. He was born in New York City, studied at the Art Students League with James Carroll Beckwith, then in Paris with Jean-Paul Laurens and Fernand Cormon.\n\nHe came from an artistic family; his father, Christian Herter (1839–1883), had co-founded Herter Brothers, a prominent New York interior design and furnishings firm. Herter Brothers closed in 1906, and Albert founded Herter Looms in 1909, a tapestry and textile design-and-manufacturing firm that was, in a sense, successor to his father's firm. In Paris, he met a fellow American art student, Adele McGinnis. They were married in 1893 and had three children: Everit Albert (1894–1918), Christian Archibald (1895–1966), and Lydia Adele (1898–1951). The couple honeymooned in Japan, then returned to Paris for the first years of their marriage. In 1898 they moved back to the United States and built a Mediterranean-style villa, called \"Près Choisis\" (later called \"The Creeks\"), in East Hampton, New York, with a studio for each of them. Herter's mother built a mansion, \"El Mirasol,\" in Santa Barbara, California, where the family spent the winters. Following his mother's death, Herter and his wife renovated the mansion and converted it into a boutique hotel. Son Everit and daughter Lydia also became artists although Everit was killed at age 24 in World War I. Son Christian became a politician, serving as governor of Massachusetts and later U.S. Secretary of State under Dwight D. Eisenhower. Adele Herter was a founding member of New York City's Cosmopolitan Club, and is remembered as a painter of still lifes and \"Society\" portraits.\n\nThe firm of Herter Brothers, (working 1864–1906), was founded by German immigrants Gustave (1830–1898) and Christian Herter (1839–1883) in New York City. It began as a furniture and upholstery shop/warehouse, but after the Civil War became one of the first American firms to provide complete interior decoration services. With their own design office and cabinet-making and upholstery workshops, Herter Brothers could provide every aspect of interior furnishing—including decorative paneling, mantels, wall and ceiling decoration, patterned floors, carpets and draperies.\n\nGustave was born illegitimate in 1830, to Johanna Christiana Maria Barbara Hagenlocher and an unnamed father, in Stuttgart, Württemberg, Germany.  Five years later, Johanna Hagenlocher married Christian Herter (1807–1874), a skilled cabinetmaker. Gustave took his stepfather's surname, and later added the \"e\" to the end of his given name. His half-brother, Christian Augustus Ludwig Herter, was born in 1839. The boys followed their stepfather/father in the furniture-making trade. Gustave Herter came to New York City in 1848, and by 1858 was working under his own name. Christian was in New York by 1859, and joined his brother in the firm (renamed Herter Brothers) by 1864. The firm was at the forefront of the panoply of furnishing styles that preceded the Mission style: Renaissance Revival, Neo-Grec, Eastlake, the Aesthetic Movement, ebonized \"Anglo-Japanese style\" furnishings of the 1870s – 1880s for which the firm is best recognized today, and the wide range of furnishings in revival styles required for Gilded Age houses.\n\n阿斯彭研究所（Aspen Institute）又称阿斯本研究所，是一个国际性非营利组织和智库，成立于1949年，当时名为阿斯本人文研究所（Aspen Institute of Humanistic Studies）或阿斯彭人文研究所。该研究所总部位于华盛顿哥伦比亚特区。\n\nThe institute was largely the creation of Walter Paepcke, a Chicago businessman who had become inspired by the Great Books program of Mortimer Adler at the University of Chicago. In 1945, Paepcke visited Bauhaus artist and architect Herbert Bayer, AIA, who had designed and built a Bauhaus-inspired minimalist home outside the decaying former mining town of Aspen, in the Roaring Fork Valley. Paepcke and Bayer envisioned a place where artists, leaders, thinkers, and musicians could gather. Shortly thereafter, while passing through Aspen on a hunting expedition, oil industry maverick Robert O. Anderson (soon to be founder and CEO of Atlantic Richfield) met with Bayer and shared in Paepcke's and Bayer's vision. In 1949, Paepcke organized a 20-day international celebration for the 200th birthday of German poet and philosopher Johann Wolfgang von Goethe. The celebration attracted over 2,000 attendees, including Albert Schweitzer, José Ortega y Gasset, Thornton Wilder, and Arthur Rubinstein.[\n\n萨克森-安哈尔特（Saxony--Anhalt）是德意志联邦共和国的一个州，州府在马格德堡。它与下萨克森州、勃兰登堡州、萨克森州和图林根州相邻 //\n\n地理\n萨克森-安哈尔特的北部是平原，这里的城市与北德的城市有着共同的历史关系，它们中有些是汉萨同盟的成员。中部是肥沃的马格德堡平原。西南部是哈茨山。南部靠近萨克森的边界上以哈雷为中心是一个重要的工业区（有“化学三角”之称）。萨克森-安哈尔特有两个重要的工业区，在南部从哈雷开始一直到萨克森州的莱比锡是德国历史上传统的重工业区，尤其以化工为主，其他工业如光学工业也是很著名的。中部以马格德堡为中心是另一个重要的工业区。马格德堡的优点是它交通方便。这座城市位于中欧东西交通要道之上，从巴黎通向华沙，甚至莫斯科的高速公路和铁路经过这里，从德国西部通向首都柏林的德国高速列车也通过此处。贯通中欧的中欧运河和从捷克既可以航行的易北河在这里相交。哈茨山区是德国的一个重要的国内旅游区。在两德统一的过程中，原东德的萨克森-安哈尔特州受到很大的经济冲击，一些过去东德重要的国营企业（如鲁纳石油提炼厂、罗伯特隆电子工业等）关闭，使萨克森-安哈尔特州许多人失业。萨克森-安哈尔特州是今天德国失业率比较高（2005年达20%）、负债也比较高的一个州，在德国联邦州中属于相对贫困州。\n\n马格德堡（Magdeburg）是德国萨克森-安哈尔特州的首府，该州仅次于哈雷的第二大城市，也是该州三个非县辖城市之一。马格德堡位于易北河畔，是基督教和天主教的主教教区首邑，拥有两所高等学府，马格德堡奥托·冯·格里克大学和马格德堡-施滕达尔应用科学大学。这个城市因曾经作为奥托一世的皇宫所在地而著名。奥托一世在962年建立神圣罗马帝国。2005，马格德堡举办了建市1200周年庆典。从语言学上讲，“Magdeburg”这个名字可以上溯到“Magadoburg”这个单词，意思可能是“Mächtige Burg”（强大的城堡）马格德堡是欧洲最重要的中世纪城市之一。神圣罗马帝国皇帝奥托一世在其大部分统治时间里都居住在这里，死后也葬于此地的主教座堂。发生在该城的重要事件包括：\n\n805年，在Diedenhof Capitulary里第一次提到了马格德堡。\n919年，亨利一世在马格德堡修筑工事以防御马扎尔人和斯拉夫人。\n929年，亨利一世安排自己的儿子奥托一世迎娶了Edward the Elder的女儿伊迪丝。在两人的婚礼上，伊迪丝收到了新婚礼物---马格德堡。伊迪丝对这座城市有着独特的喜爱并经常居住于此。937年，一个皇家聚会在马格德堡举行。同时，马格德堡主教座堂的前身圣莫里斯隐修院建立。946年，伊迪丝王后逝世并葬于修道院的地下室。\n968年，在拉韦纳宗教会议上，马格德堡总主教一职设立。总主教在德国对易北河东斯拉夫人土地的殖民过程中扮演了重要的角色。973年，奥托一世逝世并葬于马德格堡主教座堂。\n1035年，马格德堡获得了举办贸易展览和会议的特权，来自各国的游客开始集聚此的。\n1118年，马格德堡几乎被大火毁灭。\n十三世纪，马格德堡成为汉萨同盟的成员。在汉萨同盟期间，它与布鲁塞尔、安特卫普、科隆、纽伦堡、吕贝克、帕多瓦、曼托瓦、克雷莫纳、维罗纳、皮亚琴察、米兰、热那亚、佛罗伦萨、梅斯和斯特拉斯堡一同成为神圣罗马帝国中居民超过20,000的城市。马格德堡拥有一个自治的模式，称为Magdeburger Recht，后来被东欧的许多城市采用。马格德堡的市民坚持不懈地与主教斗争，到15世纪末，已基本独立于主教了。1524年，马丁·路德来到曾经就读过的马格德堡，开始鼓吹并促成该市叛离天主教。宗教改革在马格德堡迅速拥了一批信徒。\n神圣罗马帝国皇帝查理五世再次宣布已加入Alliance of Torgau和Schmalkadic League的马格德堡为非法，因为它没有接受神圣罗马帝国的“临时敕令”。在随后的几年中，马格德堡成为了新教的“堡垒”，也是第一个出版马丁·路德著作的城市。\n迪安·古德哈姆·艾奇逊（Dean Gooderham Acheson，1893年4月11日—1971年10月12日），生于康涅狄格州，美国律师、政治家，第51任美国国务卿，在其任内主导编写了《中美关系白皮书》。 1949年1月26日，艾奇逊发表声明，谓“美国对华政策不变”。1949年美国总统杜鲁门批准了由国务卿艾奇逊于国安会提出的一份秘密文件，指出小心隐藏美国将台湾从中国大陆的掌控中分离的愿景，交由联合国托管或小心推动台独或自治运动是对美国最好的结果。\n\n乔治·普拉特·舒尔茨（George Pratt Shultz，1920年—2021年），美国政治家。1920年12月13日，舒尔茨出生于纽约。1942年本科毕业于普林斯顿大学。二战期间服役于美国海军陆战队，任上尉。1949年获得麻省理工学院工业经济学博士学位。博士毕业后曾在麻省理工学院和芝加哥大学教经济学，之后曾任劳工部长、财政部长和国务卿。 Shultz was born December 13, 1920, in New York City, the only child of Margaret Lennox (née Pratt) and Birl Earl Shultz. He grew up in Englewood, New Jersey. His great-grandfather was an immigrant from Germany who arrived in the United States in the middle of the 19th century. Contrary to common assumption, Shultz was not a member of the Pratt family associated with John D. Rockefeller and the Standard Oil Trust.\n\n His senior thesis, \"The Agricultural Program of the Tennessee Valley Authority\", examined the Tennessee Valley Authority's effect on local agriculture, for which he conducted on-site research.  He graduated with honors in 1942.  In 1957, Shultz left MIT and joined the University of Chicago Graduate School of Business as a professor of industrial relations, and he served as the Graduate School of Business Dean from 1962 to 1968.  During his time in Chicago, he was influenced by Nobel Laureates Milton Friedman and George Stigler, who reinforced Shultz's view of the importance of a free-market economy.  He left the University of Chicago to serve under President Richard Nixon in 1969\n\nIn 1974, he left government service to become executive vice president of Bechtel Group, a large engineering and services company. He was later its president and a director. Under Shultz's leadership, Bechtel received contracts for many large construction projects, including from Saudi Arabia. In the year before he left Bechtel, the company reported a 50% increase in revenue.\n\nSecretary of State\nOn July 16, 1982, Shultz was appointed by President Ronald Reagan as the 60th U.S. Secretary of State, replacing Alexander Haig, who had resigned. Shultz served for six and a half years, the longest tenure since Dean Rusk's. The possibility of a conflict of interest in his position as secretary of state after being in the upper management of the Bechtel Group was raised by several senators during his confirmation hearings. Shultz briefly lost his temper in response to some questions on the subject but was nevertheless unanimously confirmed by the Senate. Shultz relied primarily on the Foreign Service to formulate and implement Reagan's foreign policy. As reported in the State Department's official history, \"by the summer of 1985, Shultz had personally selected most of the senior officials in the Department, emphasizing professional over political credentials in the process [...] The Foreign Service responded in kind by giving Shultz its 'complete support,' making him one of the most popular Secretaries since Dean Acheson.\"  Shultz's success came from not only the respect he earned from the bureaucracy but the strong relationship he forged with Reagan, who trusted him completely.\n\nDiplomatic historian Walter LaFeber states that his 1993 memoir, Turmoil and Triumph: My Years as Secretary of State, \"is the most detailed, vivid, outspoken, and reliable record we probably shall have of the 1980s until the documents are opened\" // 张爱萍出访美国，与他交过手，针锋相对，互不退让。 During the First Intifada (see Arab–Israeli conflict), Shultz \"proposed ... an international convention in April 1988 ... on an interim autonomy agreement for the West Bank and Gaza Strip, to be implemented as of October for a three-year period\". By December 1988, after six months of shuttle diplomacy, Shultz had established a diplomatic dialogue with the Palestine Liberation Organization, which was picked up by the next Administration.\n\n1971 ILWU strike\nOn July 1, 1971, members of the International Longshore and Warehouse Union (ILWU) walked out against their employers, represented by the Pacific Maritime Association (PMA). The union's goal was to secure employment, wages, and benefits in the face of increased mechanization, shrinking workforce, and the slowing economic climate of the early 1970s. The strike shut down all 56 West coast ports, including those in Canada, and lasted 130 days, the longest strike in the ILWU's history //\n\n布莱恩·塞缪尔·爱普斯坦 // Brian Samuel Epstein，1934年—1967年 // 生于利物浦，犹太人，英国披头士乐队经纪人。他的经纪公司则根据他的家族音乐事业NEMS（North End Music Stores，北角音乐店），命名为NEMS Enterprises。\n\nEpstein's grandfather, Isaac Epstein, was Lithuanian-Jewish, arriving in Britain in the 1890s from what was then part of the Russian Empire at the age of eighteen.  His grandmother Dinah was the daughter of Joseph, a draper, and Esther Hyman, who had emigrated from Russia to Britain (circa 1871/72) with their eldest son Jacob. The Hymans had six other children. // Isaac Epstein married Dinah Hyman in Manchester in 1900.  In 1901, Isaac and Dinah were living at 80 Walton Road, Liverpool, with Isaac's sister Rachael Epstein, above the furniture dealership that he founded.  Dinah and Isaac's third child, Harry Epstein, would become Brian Epstein's father.\n\nEventually the family moved to a larger home in the Anfield area of Liverpool at 27 Anfield Road. After Harry and his brother Leslie had joined the family firm, Isaac Epstein founded Epstein and Sons. He then enlarged the furniture business by taking over adjacent shops at 62/72 Walton Road to sell a range of other goods, such as musical instruments and household appliances. They called the expanding business NEMS (North End Music Stores), which offered lenient credit terms. Paul McCartney's father once bought a piano from them.[] Epstein's mother Malka (nicknamed \"Queenie\" by her family, as Malka means \"queen\" in Hebrew) was also involved in the Hyman furniture business, which also owned the Sheffield Veneering Company.  Harry and Queenie married in 1933. In 2003, the family home on Anfield Road was converted into a Beatles-themed hotel called Epstein House.\n\n查尔斯·金（Charles King）是乔治城大学的国际事务和政府学教授，此前他曾担任埃德蒙·A·沃尔什外交服务学院的院长 // Charles King (born 1967) is the Professor of International Affairs and Government at Georgetown University, where he previously served as the chairman of the faculty of the Edmund A.

King won the Francis Parkman Prize for his 2019 book Gods of the Upper Air: How a Circle of Renegade Anthropologists Reinvented Race, Sex, and Gender in the Twentieth Century\n\nThe Rank Organisation (founded as J. Arthur Rank), was a British entertainment conglomerate founded by industrialist J. Arthur Rank in April 1937, Rank also served as the company chairman. It quickly became the largest and most vertically integrated film company in the United Kingdom, owning production, distribution and exhibition facilities as well as manufacturing projection equipment and chairs.[1] It also diversified into the manufacture of radios, TVs and photocopiers (as one of the owners of Rank Xerox). The company name lasted until February 1996, when the name and some of the remaining assets were absorbed into the newly structured Rank Group plc. The company itself became a wholly owned subsidiary of Xerox and was renamed XRO Limited in 1997. // The company logo, the Gongman, first used in 1935 by the group's distribution company General Film Distributors // and seen in the opening titles of the films, became a celebrated and enduring film emblem. The company founder J. Arthur Rank, born in Kingston upon Hull, UK, was already a wealthy industrialist through his father's flour milling business, Joseph Rank Ltd, before making his start in filmmaking by financing short religious subjects in line with his Methodist beliefs. As Rank was a Methodist Sunday School Teacher, he wished to introduce these beliefs to a wider audience.\n\nThe Rank Organisation was established, as a means for Rank to consolidate his filmmaking interests, in 1937.[\n\nJocasta Innes\nJocasta Claire Traill Innes  (21 May 1934 – 20 April 2013) was a British writer, journalist and businesswoman. Innes was born in Nanjing, China, the eldest of three daughters born to Paul Joseph Anthony Innes, a Shell Oil executive and Alice Eileen née Traill, an Irish-Argentinian teacher who ran a school for the children of other British-born residents.  By the age of twelve she had lived on every continent in the world, except Antarctica. After a spell at a Coptic convent in Cairo, she was educated at Bedford High School from 1949 and Girton College, Cambridge, where she read Modern Languages. One of her first jobs was with the _Evening Standard_’s Londoners Diary, where she was known for the utterly charming way in which she gatecrashed the debutante balls that were diary fodder at the time. Her first book was the bestselling The Pauper's Cookbook[5] (1971), born as she said \"out of necessity\" during an impecunious spell. A self-taught cook, who idolised Elizabeth David, she was determined to show that making great food does not depend on buying expensive ingredients or having special expertise. This was followed by The Pauper’s Homemaking Book in 1976[] which took the same democratic approach to interiors and The Country Kitchen  which dealt with old-fashioned rural British cookery and crafts – Damson Cheese, curing hams in saltpetre and parsnip wine. //\n\nRichard B.
